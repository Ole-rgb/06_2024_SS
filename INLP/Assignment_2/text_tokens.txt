guns
should
be
banned
because
they
are
not
needed
in
any
domestic
issue
.
the
second
ammendment
was
put
in
place
because
of
fear
that
the
british
might
invade
america
again
or
take
control
of
the
government
.
if
this
were
the
case
the
people
would
need
weapons
to
defend
themselves
and
regain
america
.
the
british
are
n't
going
to
invade
so
we
do
n't
need
to
protect
our
selves
.
even
in
the
this
day
and
age
america
remains
increadible
safe
compared
to
many
other
nations
.
we
have
no
close
enemies
.
if
a
major
army
were
to
attack
us
a
few
men
with
pistols
or
shotguns
would
n't
do
much
against
a
soldier
with
an
ak47
or
tanks
or
bombers
.
guns
in
america
just
make
it
easier
for
crimes
to
be
committed
.
some
guns
should
never
be
considered
allowed
and
this
includes
all
semi
automatic
weapons
as
well
as
shotguns
.
poverty
,
drugs
,
and
lack
of
education
are
the
reasons
people
turn
to
guns
to
kill
.
guns
give
you
power
to
take
life
and
should
not
be
allowed
to
float
around
so
that
our
students
or
citizens
can
use
them
against
one
another
.
guns
may
not
kill
people
on
their
own
but
they
greatly
facilitate
the
killing
of
people
and
their
sole
purpose
unlike
most
knives
and
axes
is
to
kill
.
if
we
are
allowed
to
carry
a
tool
which
sole
purpose
is
to
kill
then
purposely
or
accidentally
we
will
harm
or
kill
someone
and
that
risk
ca
n't
be
allowed
to
exist
.
<new_line>
yes
,
guns
should
be
banned
.
guns
provide
a
trigger
for
any
violent
activity
in
the
society
,
like
the
virginia
university
incident
.
in
our
normal
life
,
we
have
a
bad
notion
for
a
particular
person
and
wish
to
kill
him
if
he
comes
forward
some
day
.
this
happens
with
everyone
.
he
might
be
our
naughty
neighbour
or
prankster
classmate
.
we
often
say
"
i
will
rip
him
into
pieces
if
he
argues
again
,
some
day
"
.
presence
of
guns
around
us
just
provide
an
acceleration
to
this
kind
of
a
thinking
and
encourages
us
to
act
upon
him
and
kill
that
person
.
so
,
guns
should
be
banned
forever
.
<new_line>
if
you
look
at
history
,
the
first
thing
empire
's
do
to
have
total
control
is
to
disarm
it
's
citizens
.
<new_line>
yes
that
might
be
true
but
are
you
suggesting
that
we
should
be
allowed
to
carry
semi
-
automatics
or
greater
weapons
?
if
our
government
wants
to
control
us
with
force
they
are
not
going
to
use
pistols
and
hunting
rifles
,
they
will
use
the
military
and
they
use
far
more
powerful
weapons
.
the
only
way
the
people
could
successfully
counter
that
is
with
weapons
of
near
equal
or
greater
power
than
what
would
be
deployed
by
the
military
or
non
-
violent
movement
such
as
the
indian
non
-
violence
peace
movement
to
overthrow
the
british
empire
in
india
.
<new_line>
gun
control
is
misguided
.
when
guns
become
illegal
for
law
-
abiding
citizens
,
only
criminals
will
have
guns
.
if
they
're
already
criminals
,
they
are
n't
following
certain
laws
,
and
will
almost
certainly
ignore
more
if
they
desire
to
do
so
.
restrictions
and
bans
on
the
availability
of
guns
to
the
normal
populace
only
encourages
crime
,
because
it
allows
criminals
to
operate
with
more
impunity
,
knowing
that
they
can
not
be
harmed
significantly
by
the
victim
of
their
crime
.
and
no
matter
how
good
the
police
are
,
they
can
not
cover
all
potential
crime
scenes
.
law
-
abiding
citizens
carrying
guns
can
defend
themselves
and
others
in
their
immediate
area
more
completely
than
even
the
best
police
force
.
prohibiting
guns
from
the
good
guys
just
means
that
the
bad
guys
are
safer
.
i
do
,
however
,
believe
that
a
mental
health
test
should
be
required
to
receive
a
concealed
-
carry
license
,
just
to
ensure
that
all
legal
gun
owners
have
the
mental
faculty
to
ensure
their
own
and
others
'
safety
.
<new_line>
you
state
that
guns
are
a
tool
that
increases
the
ease
with
which
a
crime
may
be
committed
.
but
do
any
responsible
gun
owners
succumb
to
rage
and
utilize
the
tool
that
they
carry
for
protection
of
themselves
and
others
to
kill
someone
?
are
n't
those
feelings
of
rage
and
hate
we
feel
internally
slightly
exaggerated
?
would
any
sane
,
responsible
person
be
able
to
act
externally
upon
irritation
,
even
with
a
tool
readily
available
,
to
kill
someone
?
i
think
not
.
serial
killers
and
criminals
buy
their
tools
to
kill
.
responsible
gun
owners
,
the
ones
that
follow
all
laws
regulating
gun
ownership
,
will
not
use
the
guns
they
acquired
for
a
wholly
distinct
and
opposite
purpose
to
kill
or
hurt
others
.
<new_line>
you
are
absolutely
wrong
about
the
second
amendment
being
put
in
place
to
prevent
a
british
invasion
or
coup
.
it
was
put
in
place
partially
to
allow
the
creation
of
militias
.
you
're
also
wrong
about
guns
making
crime
rates
go
higher
,
take
a
look
at
switzerland
.
men
there
are
required
to
own
automatic
weapons
and
yet
they
have
next
to
no
crime
rate
.
their
lack
of
a
standing
army
is
what
was
originally
for
seen
for
the
united
states
,
or
a
system
similar
.
a
small
standing
army
to
form
the
core
of
a
greater
force
in
times
of
war
.
that
is
what
the
second
amendment
implies
.
obviously
you
know
little
about
guns
,
a
shotgun
is
probably
one
of
the
least
threatening
weapons
to
people
.
their
limited
range
for
their
weight
and
length
makes
them
impractical
for
crime
,
but
perfect
for
the
defense
of
ones
home
.
the
guns
are
n't
the
problem
its
people
and
do
n't
start
blaming
poverty
,
or
education
.
just
because
you
're
poor
does
n't
mean
that
you
have
to
kill
someone
to
improve
your
life
.
there
are
many
ways
to
do
that
.
so
long
as
guns
exist
people
will
always
find
a
way
to
acquire
them
.
by
reducing
the
number
of
honest
,
law
abiding
citizens
with
the
capability
to
protect
themselves
from
these
criminals
you
're
asking
for
a
breakdown
of
order
.
but
i
diverge
from
the
topic
at
hand
.
point
is
only
an
idiot
points
a
gun
anywhere
near
a
person
they
do
n't
want
to
kill
.
there
's
no
such
thing
as
a
gun
related
accident
,
gun
related
deaths
almost
always
are
caused
by
carelessness
or
stupidity
or
both
.
<new_line>
great
argument
pvtnobody
,
i
could
n't
have
said
it
better
myself
.
guns
do
n't
kill
people
,
stupid
people
with
guns
kill
people
.
<new_line>
yes
i
could
have
phrased
it
better
.
you
are
right
about
the
militias
but
what
was
the
purpose
of
them
?
who
were
they
supposed
to
defend
against
,
not
just
the
british
but
they
were
certainly
a
worry
?
we
have
a
standing
army
so
why
do
we
need
a
militia
as
well
?
i
'm
not
a
gun
expert
i
agree
but
i
also
know
that
shotguns
arn't
the
most
dangerous
weapons
.
yet
what
reason
does
anyone
have
to
own
a
shotgun
?
i
included
shotguns
because
i
feel
that
there
is
no
justification
for
owning
one
not
that
i
thought
they
were
very
dangerous
.
i
'm
not
saying
poor
people
resort
to
guns
what
i
am
saying
is
that
poverty
destroys
people
's
lives
and
creates
an
atmosphere
of
fear
.
there
are
poor
people
who
are
living
the
best
they
can
with
what
society
has
thrown
at
them
.
criminals
or
gangs
might
try
to
recruit
the
poor
since
they
say
they
offer
a
better
life
.
because
of
society
the
poor
might
feel
that
they
do
n't
have
much
hope
and
that
being
in
a
criminal
organization
might
help
to
raise
them
.
i
understand
that
most
of
the
poor
do
n't
do
this
but
there
are
a
few
,
especially
in
a
city
.
a
large
reason
for
our
higher
violence
rates
is
our
society
and
maybe
not
the
presence
of
guns
alone
but
guns
make
it
easier
.
just
because
a
group
in
one
area
are
able
to
control
gun
violence(like
switzerland
)
does
not
mean
that
a
group
somewhere
else
is
.
"
there
's
no
such
thing
as
a
gun
related
accident
,
gun
related
deaths
almost
always
are
caused
by
carelessness
or
stupidity
or
both
.
"
and
thus
would
n't
that
be
an
accident
?
maybe
only
an
idiot
does
point
a
gun
near
someone
they
do
n't
want
to
kill
there
are
still
a
few
idiots
in
this
world
with
access
to
guns
.
i
understand
your
points
about
self
defense
and
i
think
it
is
the
only
and
strongest
reason
for
not
banning
guns
yet
what
guns
are
you
talking
about
?
do
you
think
we
should
be
allowed
to
own
semi
-
automatics
?
a
lot
of
the
recent
gun
deaths
in
the
news
were
when
people
were
not
at
home
.
such
as
at
virgina
tech
,
do
you
think
people
should
be
able
to
carry
guns
to
class
or
in
public
?
what
i
'm
trying
to
say
is
if
you
have
a
shotgun
at
home
yet
are
confronted
when
you
're
away
from
home
how
much
use
is
that
shotgun
?
lastly
i
talked
about
education
and
poverty
because
most
of
the
criminals
are
people
who
have
been
treated
not
well
by
society
.
there
are
those
high
level
gangs
that
did
well
but
where
did
they
begin
what
reason
did
they
have
to
go
down
such
a
path
?
there
are
too
many
gun
deaths
and
while
there
will
never
be
a
ban
in
america
i
find
it
appalling
that
so
many
fight
to
prevent
gun
restrictions
and
background
checks
.
<new_line>
of
course
guns
kill
people
,
but
that
does
n't
mean
that
they
should
be
banned
.
knives
kill
people
,
cars
kill
people
,
big
macs
kill
people
,
but
should
they
be
banned
as
well
?
first
of
all
,
it
would
be
impossible
to
ban
guns
and
expect
that
they
would
all
be
taken
off
the
street
.
they
are
too
prolific
in
america
now
and
there
's
no
turning
back
.
second
,
guns
serve
a
great
purpose
in
many
cases
,
people
just
need
to
be
educated
on
proper
gun
safety
.
additionally
,
we
should
do
more
to
ensure
the
people
who
are
getting
guns
are
capable
of
handling
them
and
are
not
likely
to
go
kill
someone
with
it
.
<new_line>
militias
still
have
their
place
,
the
national
guard
is
in
a
sense
a
militia
.
it
's
composed
of
soldiers
who
train
regularly
but
are
not
professionals
.
historically
it
was
not
the
continental
army
that
won
the
american
revolution
but
the
militias
that
fought
alongside
the
army
.
i
would
argue
that
if
you
are
pointing
a
gun
at
someone
it
is
not
an
accident
if
the
gun
goes
off
and
kills
the
person
you
are
pointing
it
at
,
period
.
the
only
restriction
on
whether
a
person
can
own
a
gun
should
be
passing
a
gun
safety
course
.
a
shotgun
has
many
uses
,
and
in
many
ways
a
shotgun
would
be
a
better
self
-
defense
weapon
than
a
handgun
it
has
significantly
more
stopping
power
and
is
much
harder
to
conceal
.
if
you
have
your
shotgun
with
you
then
it
's
a
lot
of
help
.
there
is
a
significant
number
of
people
in
the
us
that
carry
weapons
in
their
cars
for
just
the
sort
of
situation
you
describe
.
that
is
also
the
reasoning
behind
obtaining
a
concealed
carry
permit
.
finally
you
bring
up
societies
mistreatment
of
people
.
i
honestly
believe
that
people
's
lack
of
education
and
even
to
some
extent
poverty
is
more
often
than
not
a
result
of
their
own
failings
.
i
would
be
remiss
to
say
that
all
poverty
was
something
that
those
stricken
by
it
brought
it
upon
themselves
but
many
poverty
stricken
people
perpetuate
their
status
.
more
importantly
a
lack
of
scholarly
education
or
wealth
is
no
excuse
for
going
on
a
crime
spree
.
in
short
i
'll
fall
back
on
the
tried
and
true
motto
,
"
guns
do
n't
kill
people
,
people
kill
people
.
"
it
's
hard
to
argue
with
that
logic
,
modern
guns
have
so
many
safeguards
built
in
that
it
is
not
often
that
they
go
off
without
someone
pulling
the
trigger
and
never
if
it
's
not
loaded
.
<new_line>
you
argue
that
the
caliber
of
the
weapon
is
the
only
factor
in
a
fight
.
while
this
is
a
significant
factor
it
is
not
the
only
one
.
tactics
and
training
are
in
many
ways
more
important
.
finally
the
reason
why
the
only
reason
why
the
indian
non
-
violence
movement
succeeded
was
because
the
british
empire
chose
not
to
use
force
.
when
you
discuss
a
military
actively
engaging
in
suppression
of
resistance
you
've
passed
the
point
where
non
-
violent
resistance
will
work
.
<new_line>
i
did
not
mean
it
to
sound
like
the
caliber
of
the
weapons
was
the
only
factor
.
tactics
and
training
are
also
very
important
if
not
more
so
.
but
is
n't
the
american
armed
forces
better
trained
than
an
american
citizen
?
would
n't
it
be
better
than
a
militia
as
well
?
i
guess
i
do
n't
see
the
point
of
the
first
part
of
this
rebuttal
.
as
for
the
second
i
should
have
done
some
research
before
bringing
that
reference
up
nonetheless
non
-
violence
is
an
important
tactic
and
it
may
not
alone
stop
the
suppression
but
it
could
be
a
catalyst
for
something
greater
that
could
.
if
they
were
true
to
the
form
non
-
violence
could
work
,
it
just
would
be
very
bloody
.
<new_line>
the
responsible
gun
owners
that
you
are
talking
about
,
might
not
necessarily
themselves
using
guns
.
womens
and
even
children
in
those
houses
feel
like
using
those
deadly
toys
and
even
try
shoot
at
someone
.
i
am
not
saying
all
this
in
fluke
.
just
click
on
the
evidence
below
.
http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9f0ce4dd1031f933a15754c0a965958260
 
after
reading
this
,
you
might
raise
another
point
that
the
owners
should
be
responsible
and
keep
guns
away
and
keep
them
safe.blah
blah
!
but
,
then
just
answer
this
,
is
n't
it
better
not
to
buy
guns
rather
than
buying
and
hiding
it
from
wrong
hands
?
<new_line>
firstly
,
knives
and
cars
are
not
commonly
used
to
murder
people
.
cars
just
cause
accidents
,
that
is
not
the
reason
why
cars
should
be
banned
.
guns
are
a
sure
way
to
finish
people
off
!
and
anyone
can
use
them
to
kill
others
,
that
is
the
reason
why
guns
should
be
banned
.
secondly
,
how
do
guns
serve
a
great
purpose
,
as
you
said
,
in
many
cases
?
they
help
to
kill
somebody
we
hate
?
well
!
that
is
badly
justified
!
!
moreover
,
there
is
no
way
of
ensuring
that
the
people
who
are
getting
guns
are
capable
of
handling
them
and
are
not
likely
to
go
kill
someone
with
it
.
<new_line>
and
that
my
friend
,
is
why
vietnam
was
lost
.
the
guerrillas
were
indeed
poorly
trained
,
compared
to
the
american
gi
,
however
they
were
far
superior
to
the
gi
in
terrain
mobility
and
knowlegibility
of
the
battlefield
.
that
is
why
a
standing
militia
is
often
incorporated
into
the
defense
force
because
of
their
greater
defensive
potential
.
moreover
,
the
american
armed
forces
is
a
largely
offensive
unit
,
indeed
they
are
trained
to
deal
with
hostile
environments
,
rather
than
sympathetic
ones
,
although
some
more
advanced
units
are
given
training
in
insugency
.
also
,
the
whole
point
of
a
militant
revolt
is
to
avoid
excessive
bloodshed
on
the
rebelling
side
.
<new_line>
mmm
,
i
agree
with
your
first
two
points
,
however
just
because
stupid
people
obtain
guns
is
no
reason
to
ban
them
.
stupid
people
are
voted
for
all
the
time
(
you
know
who
i
mean
)
but
does
that
justify
preventing
the
election
process
?
<new_line>
mmm
,
yes
,
if
we
take
switzerland
as
an
example
again
,
they
have
compulsory
consription
for
all
young
men
where
they
learn
about
their
automated
weapons
,
discipline
,
responsibility
and
all
that
jazz
.
it
also
effectively
renders
the
entire
able
bodied
male
population
of
switzerland
potential
,
trained
militia
.
service
is
optional
for
women
there
.
prehaps
an
educational
camp
is
what
is
needed
for
responsible
gun
ownership
.
<new_line>
then
we
should
ban
so
stupid
people
ca
n't
kill
people
with
guns
.
<new_line>
it
's
not
really
accurate
to
say
that
vietnam
was
lost
in
a
military
sense
.
we
lost
the
war
because
there
was
no
political
backing
and
withdrew
before
the
job
was
complete
.
but
the
guerrilla
tactics
used
by
the
viet
cong
and
the
north
vietnamese
certainly
gave
our
soldiers
a
hell
of
a
fight
.
militias
are
definitely
best
suited
for
defense
,
a
well
trained
militia
knows
the
terrain
,
prepares
for
likely
invasions
and
drills
often
enough
that
it
can
deal
with
any
uncertainties
.
do
n't
underestimate
the
strength
of
an
out
gunned
,
dedicated
force
that
knows
the
battlefield
better
than
the
enemy
.
the
american
revolution
was
one
by
such
a
force
.
<new_line>
so
we
should
make
driving
illegal
because
a
relatively
small
fraction
of
the
population
chooses
to
drive
drunk
?
<new_line>
the
vietnamese
were
defending
their
home
;
they
knew
the
terrain
.
the
american
army
did
n't
know
it
nearly
as
well
and
was
n't
prepared
for
the
war
they
were
going
to
fight
.
i
think
that
if
the
american
armed
forces
were
going
to
suppress
its
own
people
they
would
be
better
prepared
because
of
what
they
learned
in
vietnam
and
far
more
knowledgeable
of
the
terrain
.
also
now
they
have
far
better
intelligence
technology
than
during
the
vietnam
war
.
before
vietnam
and
korea
the
american
armed
forces
did
not
have
to
deal
with
a
solely
guerrilla
war
and
thus
were
not
as
prepared
as
they
are
now
.
lastly
,
no
matter
if
the
rebelling
side
is
using
peaceful
means
or
armed
as
it
appears
you
are
supporting
,
there
will
be
excessive
bloodshed
.
yes
america
lost
vietnam(and
around
60,000
people
)
but
the
vietnamese
lost
more
than
a
million
troops
and
civilians
at
least
(
i
'm
only
counting
deaths
)
.
they
were
less
trained
and
they
had
weapons
but
that
did
nothing
to
reduce
the
amount
of
losses
that
they
endured
.
<new_line>
jits
 
both
are
used
to
'
murder
'
people
all
the
time
.
it
is
true
that
guns
are
responsible
for
the
majority
of
murders
but
knives
are
number
two
and
cars
are
considered
weapons
by
the
police
.
your
point
is
that
guns
murder
people
so
they
should
be
banned
.
if
that
truly
is
your
sole
point
then
that
's
riduculous
because
banning
guns
wo
nt
stop
murders
.
murderers
will
just
use
something
else
;
knives
,
poisons
,
explosives
,
their
own
hands
.
do
you
really
think
a
criminal
intent
on
killing
will
say
to
himself
,
"
darn
,
i
ca
n't
kill
now
because
guns
are
illegal
?
"
.
jits
.
do
you
collect
anything
,
pez
dispensers
,
baseball
cards
,
broken
hearts
...
anything
?
if
you
do
maybe
you
'll
be
able
to
relate
to
the
need
for
guns
.
think
about
it
.
guns
represent
history
.
guns
represent
the
ingenuity
of
man
.
guns
are
one
of
the
simplest
,
most
efficient
machines
ever
created
.
take
some
time
to
look
beyond
the
obvious
...
gun
kill
...
gun
bad
.
<new_line>
i
disagree
with
your
point
:
just
consider
the
prime
uses
of
the
things
which
are
considered
weapons
by
you
.
firstly
,
the
prime
use
of
cars
are
transportation
.
they
are
commomly
used
to
move
from
one
place
to
another
by
the
common
people
.
you
say
that
cars
are
considered
as
weapons
by
the
cops
?
they
are
not
considered
as
a
weapons
.
they
are
used
by
cops
as
roadblocks
and
chasing
activities
.
do
you
think
them
as
murders
?
quite
funny
though
!
that
is
a
funny
point
you
have
raised
.
secondly
,
just
think
about
the
prime
use
of
a
knife
.
they
are
commonly
used
in
domestic
kitchen
activities
.
now
,
think
about
the
prime
use
of
a
gun
.
even
a
child
knows
that
guns
are
used
for
killing
.
(
other
than
defense
in
the
army
,
obviously
,
guns
ca
n't
be
banned
for
the
army
)
.
then
why
not
ban
guns
,
when
they
kill
.
even
the
keyboard
that
you
are
typing
on
can
be
used
to
kill
people
if
hit
at
main
areas
of
the
body
.
all
is
on
the
mentality
of
the
people
.
and
,
as
i
mentioned
in
my
first
point
,
presence
of
gun
can
originate
offensive
mentality
in
the
owner
.

<new_line>
not
too
long
ago
i
would
have
,
without
hesitation
said
yes
.
but
given
the
drift
in
this
country
to
more
and
more
centralization
of
power
in
the
presidency
i
am
not
so
sure
.
i
wonder
about
forces
such
as
blackwater
;
is
this
destined
to
be
a
private
force
of
the
executive
?
what
if
mccain
is
elected
?
he
believes
in
'
winning
the
war
'
on
terrorism
.
i
believe
he
will
naturally
seek
to
exert
increased
control
over
security
to
the
detriment
of
constitutional
safeguards
of
liberty
.
it
may
take
ordinary
citizens
,
armed
,
to
ultimately
defend
our
constitution
.
our
founding
fathers
fought
against
linger
odds
.
it
reminds
of
something
i
once
read
---
what
if
every
jew
in
hitler
's
germany
killed
one
ss
troop
as
he
came
to
arrest
him
?
the
number
of
jews
vastly
outnumbered
the
german
ss
.
<new_line>
why
not
provide
more
education
to
those
with
guns
?
banning
guns
altogether
is
not
a
viable
option
and
not
even
in
the
realm
of
possibility
.
<new_line>
there
are
essentially
two
arguments
for
the
ownership
of
/
legality
of
guns
in
american
(
outside
of
the
second
amendment
)
.
1
)
protection
-
the
argument
suggests
that
guns
protect
us
from
dangerous
individuals
.
the
problem
is
that
we
are
the
dangerous
individuals
.
from
accidents
,
to
insanity
,
to
alcohol
or
drug
-
fueled
violence
,
we
are
the
ones
doing
this
damage
.
the
best
mode
of
protection
is
the
removal
of
firearms
from
society
.
2
)
entertainment
/
sport
-
shooting
is
fun
.
i
love
it
.
skeet
,
target
,
and
hunting
are
fun
pastimes
.
i
was
trained
as
a
boy
to
properly
care
for
,
handle
,
and
shoot
a
fire
arm
.
i
was
10
years
old
when
i
shot
my
first
.22
and
i
was
hooked
.
i
would
love
to
pass
these
skills
onto
my
son
,
but
not
at
the
cost
of
so
much
death
and
destruction
caused
by
the
improper
use
of
guns
.
i
would
rather
pass
on
a
safer
society
.
i
've
heard
all
of
the
arguments
and
both
sides
are
certainly
passionate
about
their
beliefs
.
here
are
some
of
my
rebuttals
to
common
counter
-
arguments
.
guns
do
n't
kill
people
,
people
kill
people
:
absolutely
true
,
but
guns
allow
people
to
kill
people
with
greater
efficiency
,
which
is
not
necessarily
a
good
thing
outside
of
the
battlefield
.
if
guns
are
outlawed
,
only
outlaws
would
have
guns
:
actually
,
not
true
.
outlaws
and
law
enforcement
would
have
guns
.
criminals
will
find
ways
to
get
guns
:
true
,
but
the
supply
will
be
much
lower
the
demand
much
higher
,
thus
making
it
more
expensive
,
thus
more
difficult
,
to
get
a
gun
.
<new_line>
guns
should
be
far
more
restricted
than
they
are
now
.
we
have
far
higher
murder
rates
than
almost
any
other
first
-
world
country
.
yes
,
it
's
important
to
protect
2nd
amendment
rights
.
but
they
should
not
be
unrestricted
.
in
arizona
,
the
republican
led
state
legislature
has
become
enamored
with
a
law
allowing
concealed
weapons
on
every
university
campus
in
the
state
-
the
schools
can
not
ban
them
.
what
's
worse
,
they
originally
wanted
to
extend
that
to
the
public
school
system
!
i
have
a
number
of
friends
who
are
good
,
honorable
gun
owners
.
i
know
they
are
very
responsible
with
their
weapons
.
i
also
have
a
friend
who
is
border
-
line
mentally
disabled
,
and
was
given
a
concealed
weapons
permit
.
once
,
i
took
him
to
the
local
convenience
store
to
buy
him
a
coke
.
when
we
returned
,
there
was
a
guy
walking
toward
the
house
,
with
the
intention
of
stealing
his
bike
.
"
oh
no
!
i
've
got
my
.45
there
!
"
this
nitwit
left
a
loaded
.45
in
a
bike
bag
,
and
parked
the
bike
in
the
driveway
unlocked
-
instead
of
leaving
it
inside
the
fenced
yard
,
which
was
guarded
by
a
rottweiler
and
a
german
shepard
!
never
mind
the
fact
that
had
he
said
something
,
of
course
he
could
have
put
the
freaking
thing
in
the
locked
house
!
he
's
a
security
guard
,
and
a
few
months
later
he
decided
to
take
the
gun
to
work
.
never
mind
that
he
's
only
licensed
as
an
unarmed
guard
.
it
's
against
the
law
for
him
to
have
a
gun
with
him
.
never
mind
that
the
company
he
worked
for
did
n't
have
a
license
for
him
to
have
it
,
either
.
so
what
does
he
do
?
of
course
!
he
left
the
same
loaded
.45
in
his
lunch
box
,
unguarded
on
his
desk
at
work
,
where
it
was
stolen
!
i
have
two
huge
problems
with
both
these
situations
:
1
.
i
completely
object
to
being
forcibly
made
part
of
a
gun
battle
between
someone
like
this
and
a
shooter
.
i
know
this
guy
,
and
he
's
more
likely
to
have
the
gun
taken
from
him
and
used
against
him
or
someone
like
me
,
than
he
ever
would
be
to
defend
anyone
.
2
.
people
like
this
unwittingly
supply
the
black
market
to
street
thugs
at
discount
prices
no
less
.
his
right
to
a
gun
has
to
be
weighed
against
my
right
to
be
secured
from
his
negligence
.
do
n't
involve
me
in
a
fantasy
some
people
seem
to
have
that
this
is
the
wild
west
and
every
theater
and
fast
food
place
is
the
ok
corral
.
responsible
gun
ownership
,
please
?
!
<new_line>
while
i
do
n't
think
an
outright
ban
is
impossible
,
i
do
think
better
education
and
visibility
is
a
good
idea
.
for
instance
,
every
gun
should
be
sold
with
a
bright
orange
,
lockable
case
with
a
flashing
light
on
it
.
every
home
containing
a
firearm
should
have
a
sign
outside
with
the
number
of
guns
within
.
in
short
,
gun
ownership
should
be
as
conspicuous
as
possible
.
<new_line>
responsible
gun
owners
know
how
to
protect
their
guns
from
harmful
use
.
<new_line>
most
objects
have
the
potential
to
be
a
threat
.
a
knife
sitting
on
a
kitchen
table
may
be
harmless
but
in
the
hands
of
a
thief
it
can
be
deadly
.
guns
have
more
potential
to
be
dangerous
than
knives
but
simply
being
dangerous
is
not
grounds
for
banning
an
object
.
<new_line>
two
societies
of
200
random
individuals
,
one
with
guns
and
one
with
no
guns
.
the
answer
is
obvious
,
a
society
without
guns
has
less
opportunity
,
risk
and
danger
than
a
society
with
guns
.
in
a
worldwide
population
of
billions
,
many
would
have
lived
if
opportunities
to
kill
with
guns
had
never
arisen
.
<new_line>
well
you
guys
have
answered
the
question
already
danielcraig
and
ta9798
.
a
totally
sensible
approach
with
the
only
,
somewhat
irrational
argument
for
retaining
your
weapons
to
defend
against
the
government
!
sorry
thedert
,
but
hardly
likely
or
relevant
,
at
least
we
hope
!
lets
face
it
,
history
dictates
we
are
hardly
a
nice
race
are
we
?
we
use
any
excuse
to
batter
the
living
daylights
out
of
each
other
;
race
,
religion
,
fun
,
etc
.
to
think
how
much
more
advanced
we
'd
be
if
we
did
n't
constantly
flatten
everything
we
've
spent
time
and
money
building
and
spent
those
resources
on
developing
our
society
.
but
hey
,
it
'll
never
happen
.
it
's
a
sad
world
we
live
in
where
certain
life
forms
find
it
necessary
to
fly
planes
into
buildings
.
disarming
the
terminally
insane
would
be
a
good
start
,
but
who
's
to
judge
who
're
the
insane
?
!
<new_line>
plain
and
simple
.
gun
laws
do
not
work
places
with
strict
guns
laws
are
some
of
the
most
dangerous
places
in
the
nation
and
places
like
parts
of
texas
where
guns
are
required
are
the
safest
.
yes
i
think
parent
should
lock
up
there
guns
so
children
can
not
get
them
.
no
one
want
to
see
a
child
killed
but
banning
guns
is
really
a
bad
idea
it
's
not
good
here
and
has
been
bad
in
the
uk
.

<new_line>
a
militia
of
citizens
with
guns
will
be
our
last
line
of
defense
in
the
case
of
a
government
or
military
coup
.
properly
trained
and
licensed
civilian
gun
owners
can
protect
themselves
and
their
neighbors
in
the
case
of
enemy
invasion
,
robberies
,
and
other
crimes
.
banning
guns
in
the
u.s
.
would
be
a
huge
mistake
,
plus
it
would
piss
off
all
the
gun
owners
who
use
their
weapons
for
hunting
and
sport
.
additionally
,
it
would
create
a
huge
black
market
for
illegal
(
all
)
guns
.
<new_line>
i
think
you
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
the
black
market
argument
but
do
you
really
think
that
there
are
enough
properly
trained
and
licensed
civilian
gun
owners
to
challenge
the
us
military
?
there
is
no
way
the
civilians
could
win
.
that
argument
is
just
silly
.
<new_line>
now
i
'm
not
saying
that
all
the
properly
licensed
and
trained
civilians
in
the
u.s
.
would
be
able
to
stand
up
against
the
military
if
a
coup
occured
.
but
if
that
did
happen
,
many
of
the
members
of
the
military
would
get
out
and
join
the
civilian
population
and
defend
the
counry
's
interest
.
not
every
member
of
the
military
is
a
brainwashed
drone
who
will
follow
any
order
given
to
them
without
thought
.
but
considering
that
there
are
many
more
civilians
than
there
are
members
of
the
military
would
make
things
difficult
for
the
military
.
plus
think
about
the
police
departments
,
they
can
provide
a
lot
of
help
in
a
situation
where
civilians
will
need
defense
.
it
does
n't
take
long
to
train
someone
how
to
defend
themselves
with
a
gun
.
i
think
this
situation
would
be
extremely
rare
though
.
<new_line>
any
one
that
says
guns
should
be
banned
in
the
usa
of
needs
to
move
out
of
the
usa
.
this
is
america
,
stop
walking
around
with
your
tails
between
your
legs
and
start
acting
like
an
american
.
guns
do
nt
kill

<new_line>

<new_line>
greater

,
yes
.

no
.
<new_line>
i
think
the
whole
debate
revolves
around
whether
or
not
you
believe
people
are
capable
or
incapable
of
behaving
properly
in
the
presence
of
a
gun
.
if
you
are
a
conservative
you
believe
people
are
capable
.
progressives
(
liberals
)
believe
people
incapable
.
to
take
it
further
,
if
i
believe
you
are
capable
then
it
's
consistent
that
i
demand
accountability
from
you
when
you
choose
not
the
behave
properly
.
there
is
a
basic
truth
that
applies
here
:
capable
is
to
accountable
as
incapable
is
to
unaccountable
.
before
you
respond
back
,
consider
which
ideology
seeks
to
hold
others
unaccountable
and
you
have
identified
those
who
believe
others
incapable
.
<new_line>
you
make
a
good
point
pvtnobody
,
but
at
the
bottom
of
the
article
in
your
supporint
evidence
it
reads
:
"
it
has
none
of
the
social
problems
associated
with
gun
crime
seen
in
other
industrialised
countries
like
drugs
or
urban
deprivation
.
"
thus
,
i
do
n't
know
if
comparing
the
swiss
to
the
us
with
respect
to
guns
is
appropriate
.
<new_line>
making
guns
illegal
would
n't
solve
anything
except
to
take
them
away
from
people
that
want
to
defend
themselves
.
is
marijuana
legal
?
no
?
then
why
is
it
so
easy
to
get
a
hold
of
?
banning
guns
will
not
keep
them
out
of
the
hands
of
criminals
.
if
someone
wanted
to
get
a
gun
,
they
'd
find
a
way
.
<new_line>
i
do
n't
understand
why
this
is
even
necessary
.
why
should
we
put
any
faith
at
all
in
a
civilian
staged
armed
-
offensive
as
the
only
resort
to
deal
with
corrupt
governments
?
that
is
plainly
an
anti
-
authoritarian
,
barbaric
and
paranoid
state
of
society
which
has
no
faith
in
it
's
democratic
and
legal
system
.
civilians
do
n't
need
to
be
military
trained
just
-
in
-
case
-
we
-
need
-
to
-
take
-
over
-
the
-
country
.
that
is
more
of
a
problem
where
such
small
factions
may
start
gang
-
based
violence
than
any
paranoid
delusion
of
a
menacing
unjust
government
.
there
is
no
need
for
every
bob
and
mary
to
own
a
gun
to
ensure
a
peaceful
future
.
use
your
vote
,
use
your

<new_line>
"
only
criminals
have
guns
"
that
s
untrue
because
the
authorities
will
always
also
have
guns
and
have
better
training
,
tactics
as
well
.
if
criminals
choose
to
guns
then
they
will
also
deal
with
the
consequence
eventually
.
gun
control
's
main
purpose
is
to
reduce
opportunity
.
guns
make
it
quicker
,
easier
and
less
painful
to
end
life
.
statistically
it
is
proven
that
the
availability
of
guns
increases
the
chance
of
purposeful
and
accidental
death
.
there
is
no
reason
law
-
abiding
citizens
need
to
defend
themselves
as
they
are
untrained
,
do
not
have
full
knowledge
of
the
law
and
eventually
cause
more
harm
than
good
by
owning
such
weapons
.
the
odds
are
against
criminals
and
even
tho
gun
control
may
never
be
complete
,
it
significantly
reduces
the
likelihood
of
death
by
firearm
by
lessening
the
chances
and
increasing
the
difficulty
to
acquire
firearms
.
<new_line>
remember
how
hitler
took
over
germany
single
handedly
?
he
registered
everyones
guns
so
that
he
knew
where
they
were
and
who
had
them
....
then
took
the
guns
so
that
the
citizens
could
n't
fight
back
.
the
crime
rate
in
washington
d.c
.
has
more
than
doubled
since
guns
were
banned-
this
is
because
the
people
who
were
committing
the
crimes
did
n't
get
rid
of
their
guns
because
they
do
nt
follow
the
law
!
<new_line>
what
about
the
'
right
to
bare
arms
'
?
<new_line>
ever
heard
of
target
shooting
or
hunting
?
also
what
if
you
have
a
varmint
problem
?
and
even
if
you
ban
guns
criminals
can
still
buy
guns
illegally
and
then
the
only
people
with
guns
would
be
criminals
...
and
the
police
,
but
what
if
the
police
are
n't
around
should
n't
you
have
the
right
to
defend
yourself
?
also
guns
do
n't
mean
that
people
are
more
likely
to
commit
crime
or
even
kill
people
.
look
at
switzerland
,
they
have
the
second
highest
gun
ownership
rate
in
the
world
(
second
only
to
the
usa
)
,
and
a
large
percentage
of
those
are
government
issued
assault
rifles
,
yet
they
have
a
much
lower
crime
rate
than
the
us
.
the
problem
is
n't
guns
it
's
poverty
and
lack
of
education
we
should
be
working
on
those
instead
of
blaming
guns
for
all
our
problems
.
<new_line>
ever
heard
of
the
vietnam
war
,
or
the
1973
afghanistan
war
?
both
had
poorly
trained
,
poorly
armed
forces
defeating
the
two
most
powerful
militaries
of
their
time
.
also
high
tech
weapons
and
training
are
only
a
small
part
in
winning
a
war
,
if
it
was
n't
do
n't
you
think
the
iraqi
insurgencies
would
have
lost
by
now
?
my
point
is
:
in
a
war
between
the
us
army
and
the
american
people
the
army
would
have
a
very
hard
time
even
if
the
people
only
had
hunting
rifles
and
pistols
.
<new_line>
yes
i
have
heard
about
both
wars
and
i
even
mention
the
vietnam
war
in
one
of
my
posts
on
this
subject
.
i
believe
i
have
already
explained
why
i
think
they
are
different
than
today
.
also
as
pvtnobody
said
,
the
political
pressure
on
america
to
leave
the
vietnam
war
did
have
an
effect
on
america
losing
that
war
.
but
that
was
back
in
the
60s
,
do
n't
you
think
that
our
weapon
's
technology
has
increased
by
then
?
the
times
have
changed
and
yes
the
us
gov
would
have
trouble
attacking
its
own
people
,
and
i
would
hope
that
our
military
would
be
patriotic
enough
to
disobey
orders
to
attack
their
own
country
but
the
us
gov
knows
america
better
than
it
knows
any
other
nation
.
also
god
forbid
the
us
might
consider
using
light
nuclear
weapons
on
more
remote
areas
,
because
who
would
retaliate
?
the
afghanistan
war
against
the
soviets
was
lost
on
their
part
because
they
had
an
awful
plan
and
did
n't
properly
prepare
for
the
war
and
the
afghan
forces
had
assistance
from
us
and
the
cia
as
well
as
us
weapons
and
money
.
to
best
defeat
you
enemy
you
need
to
understand
your
enemy
,
america
did
n't
understand
its
enemies
as
well
as
it
should
have
and
that
has
hurt
america
's
wars
.
as
for
you
other
post
about
switzerland
and
target
hunting
and
such
.
if
you
read
pvtnobody
also
talked
about
switzerland
's
gun
policies
so
there
is
no
need
to
bring
it
up
again
since
it
is
n't
new
info
.
i
do
agree
however
that
poverty
and
lack
of
education
are
major
causes
of
crimes
and
i
believe
i
mentioned
that
earlier
as
well
.
like
i
also
said
guns
may
not
kill
people
alone
but
they
give
the
person
a
tool
that
greatly
facilitates
killing
if
that
is
what
the
person
wants
at
that
time
.
<new_line>
i
just
want
to
clarify
one
point
.
you
are
aware
that
semi
-
automatics
are
just
guns
that
reload
once
after
shooting
,
not
guns
that
can
shoot
two
or
more
bullets
per
trigger
pull
,
right
?
because
the
latter
is
illegal
in
the
us
and
in
most
places
.
(
well
not
exactly
,
you
can
legally
own
burst
-
firing
and
even
full
autos
in
some
states
but
it
's
a
long
and
expensive
process
)
.
also
the
large
majority
of
guns
owned
are
semi
-
autos
.
and
one
more
thing
shotguns
are
probably
the
best
guns
for
hunting
any
fowl
.
<new_line>

<new_line>
a

no

there

a
difference

a

is
dangerous
because

can
run

over

it
is
not
a
threat
.
it
can
be
a
threat
if
it
's
driven
by
a
mad
man
.
drugs
are
not
'
dangerous
'
just
sitting
on
a
table
with
no
-
one
to
consume
them
.
they
become
a
threat
when
they
are
handed
out
to
kids
on
the
street
.
<new_line>
i
thought
that

you
look
at
iraq

and
see
our

correct

does
nt
really
smash
the

<new_line>
you
make
a
legitimate
point
:
the
right
to
bear
arms
may
no
longer
afford
much
real
protection
against
would
-
be
despots
,
and
judging
from
the
arguments
made
in
this
debate
,
it
may
even
have
lost
much
of
its
symbolic
value
.
however
,
changing
our

is
something
we
should
never
take
lightly
.
the

is
fundamentally
about
preventing
the
government
from
gaining
coercive
power
.
taking
that
away
in
an
attempt
to
make
it
harder
for
criminals
to
commit
crimes
would
fundamentally
change
what
it
means
to
be
a
us
citizen
.
<new_line>
that
is
exactly
the
argument
and
is
the
rationale
behind
the
2nd
amendment
.
<new_line>
gun
control
laws
simply
do
n't
work
.
just
look
at
the
violent
crime
rates
of
areas
with
strict
gun
control
laws
,
such
as
washington
d.c
.
and
the
u.k
.
(
both
of
which
have
gun
bans
)
.
then
compare
it
to
areas
with
less
gun
control
laws
,
such
as
texas
and
arizona
(
where
concealed
carry
permits
are
fairly
easy
to
obtain
)
.
the
difference
is
huge
because
criminals
are
far
less
likely
to
commit
a
crime
if
they
think
that
the
victim
could
be
armed
.
their
was
also
a
study
(
i
do
n't
have
the
link
handy
)
that
showed
that
the
majority
of
violent
crimes
involving
guns
,
the
gun
that
was
used
by
the
criminal
was
obtained
illegally
.
that
's
what
criminals
do
,
they
break
the
law
.
if
someone
is
really
going
to
commit
a
crime
with
a
gun
,
then
why
would
they
choose
to
obey
any
gun
control
laws
?
i
believe
that
thomas
jefferson
said
it
best
when
he
said
,
"
laws
that
forbid
the
carrying
of
arms
.
.
.
disarm
only
those
who
are
neither
inclined
nor
determined
to
commit
crimes
.
.
.
such
laws
make
things
worse
for
the
assaulted
and
better
for
the
assailants
;
they
serve
rather
to
encourage
than
to
prevent
homicides
,
for
an
unarmed
man
may
be
attacked
with
greater
confidence
than
an
armed
man
.

the
facts
are
pretty
clear
that
in
countries
where
guns
are
allowed
,
more
people
are
shot
and
killed
.
in
1999
,
there
were
28,874
gun
-
related
deaths
in
the

-
over
80
deaths
every

57

75,685

what
,
exactly
,
is
the
point
of
guns
?
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
america
has
a
culture
where
guns
are
ok
,
and
the
only
thing
that
is
ever
going
to
do
is
mean
a
great
increase
in
gun
crime

guns
are
pointless

<new_line>
the
second
amendment
to
 
the
united
states
constitution
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
.
i
,
for
one
,
am
happy
to
know
that
i
live
in
a
democratic
nation
that
has
a
fail
safe
built
into
it
.
if
it
were
to
fail
,
be
over
run
by
a
tyrant
or
whatever
the
case
,
if
it
were
to
fail
,
i
would
have
a
fighting
chance
,
and
so
would
my
peers
.
i
think
disturbing
the
constitution
is
a
bad
idea
,
especially
when
we
're
talking
about
something
like
the
2nd
amendment
.
if
you
touch
the
constitution
,
and
at
the
same
time
,
strip
the
people
of
it
's
property
,
and
the
property
of
which
could
help
protect
them
in
dire
situations
,
you
're
going
to
have
a
reason
to
amend
the
constitution
again
because
there
will
be
a
revolt
.
you
know
what
i
mean
?
you
are
changing
the
game
,
and
then
you
are
making
it
to
where
it
's
harder
to
keep
fair
if
they
wanted
to
change
it
again
,
and
on
top
of
all
of
that
,
it
's
not
a
belief
that
's
being
taken
from
them
,
like
the
belief
of
freedom
,
it
's
a
material
possession
that
has
the
power
to
defend
itself
,
while
in
the
right
hands
.
tobacco
,
which
i
am
all
too
familiar
with
,
was
responsible
for
18.1
%
of
deaths
in
the
u.s
.
in
year
2000
.
435,000
deaths
in
2000
compared
to
firearm
related
deaths
at
29,573
in
2001
.
look
at
the
difference
there
!
405,427
more
people
died
by
smoking
than
being
shot
...
what
do
cigarettes
do
to
protect
the
citizens
from
each
other
or
the
government
?
i
would
have
to
say
,
only
calm
one
down
a
little
for
a
short
amount
of
time
and
make
their
fight
weaker
and
more
difficult
to
endure
.
if
we
're
going
to
do
anything
concerning
the
second
amendment
,
it
should
be
to
teach
gun
safety
in
classes
as
a
sort
of
d.a.r.e
.
like
program
.
just
because
we
teach
people
about
drugs
does
n't
mean
they
'll
seek
them
out
,
this
should
be
the
same
with
firearms
.
i
do
think
that
we
need
to
keep
guns
off
of
the
streets
,
but
this
is
n't
a
gun
issue
,
it
's
a
fairly
complex
societal
issue
.
<new_line>
the
problem
is
that
the
police
system
is
not
efficient
enough
to
put
those
superior
tactics
into
play
when
they
are
needed
most
.
there
are
too
many
cases
in
which
the
police
never
have
a
chance
to
respond
to
a
threat
before
a
criminal
acts
,
but
an
armed
citizen
in
the
same
situation
could
prevent
the
crime
.
gun
control
does
nothing
to
reduce
the
availability
of
illegal
arms
.
there
is
no
reason
for
a
criminal
to
recognize
and
abide
by
gun
control
laws
if
he
/
she
is
going
to
commit
a
violent
crime
anyway
.
gun
control
does
n't
reduce
the
opportunities
for
violent
crime
,
it
reduces
the
opportunity
for
a
timely
response
by
a
responsible
citizen
who
could
negate
the
threat
responsibly
and
quickly
.
<new_line>
that
provides
no
logical
defense
for
your
side
.
<new_line>
after
sifting
through
the
grammatical
errors
,
i
believe
i
have
found
the
point
you
intended
to
make
.
the
reality
of
statistics
reveals
that
the
uk
's
violent
crime
rate
is
far
higher
than
that
of
the
us
.
the
uk
has
effectively
disarmed
its
responsible
citizens
,
but
done
nothing
to
limit
the
black
market
of
arms
that
criminals
are
utilizing
to
perpetrate
the
crimes
.
the
result
is
that
the
criminals
have
a
much
safer
job
than
they
would
if
responsible
citizens
were
armed
.
<new_line>
making
a
law
prohibiting
guns
does
very
little
to
limit
the
availability
of
guns
to
a
criminal
.
a
criminal
has
no
reason
to
abide
by
that
law
if
he
/
she
is
going
to
break
another
one
.
the
black
market
remains
available
regardless
of
what
laws
are
used
to
disarm
law
abiding
citizens
.
<new_line>
so
,
based
on
your
argument
there
should
be
no
laws
since
people
will
always
break
them
?
<new_line>
that
was
almost
a
good
point
,
i
was
totally
against
guns
before
and
that
nearly
dented
my
opinion
.
but
then
i
could
n't
help
but
wonder
whether
his
(
jefferson
's
)
views
on
the
matter
would
be
the
same
if
he
could
have
foreseen
the
future
of
"
arms
"
.
that
is
:
mass
commoditisation
of
personal
weaponry
.
the
lethality
and
diminutive
nature
of
such
weaponry
.
the
rate
of
fire
of
these
weapons
and
the
speed
of
reloading
.
and
whether
he
'd
consider
it
still
pertinent
when
the
government
owns
and
deploys
tanks
,
hmgs
and
fighters
on
home
soil
.
which
of
course
,
in
order
to
remove
such
a
government
,
would
require
not
just
pistols
and
other
personal
weaponry
but
at
least
rpgs
and
sams
.
i
wonder
whether
(
wish
)
he
would
have
restricted
it
(
the
2nd
amendment
)
to
contemporary
weaponry
of
his
time
,
that
is
:
"
muskets
(
36
+
inches
long
)
and
single
shot
pistols
"
.
but
now
i
am
not
100
%
for
a
total
ban
,
as
i
'd
love
to
see
"
cops
"
the
tv
show
with
them
running
around
with
huge
heavy
muskets
and
taking
20
+
seconds
to
reload
their
pistols
.
also
columbine
would
have
gone
from
un
-
fucking
-
believable
horror
to
almost
sublime
comedy
.
<new_line>
i
've
been
on
both
sides
of
this
argument
and
i
can
certainly
sympathize
with
the
respective
positions
.
i
've
always
found
it
interesting
that
liberal
argument
on
gun
control
is
seen
to
be
derived
from
a
presupposition
that
individuals
can
not
act
responsibly
with
the
possession
of
firearms
while
at
the
same
time
assuming
that
collective
bodies
of
individuals
(
such
as
our
federal
government
)
can
be
or
is
a
organization
that
will
responsibly
conduct
legislation
and
execute
public
policy
and
laws
to
the
betterment
of
the
public
good
.
on
the
other
side
,
the
conservative
argument
proceeds
from
both
the
standpoint
that
the
individual
can
act
responsibly
with
a
firearm
and/or
(
agreeing
somewhat
with
the
liberal
basis
)
does
not
want
to
be
found
without
a
firearm
in
the
company
of
irresponsible
individuals
who
are
carrying
guns
.
it
is
also
interesting
that
the
former
basis
for
the
conservative
argument
assumes
that
the
right
to
bare
arms
is
the
responsible
individuals
right
to
protect
themselves
against
a
hypothetical
attack
or
control
of
an
irresponsible
collective
body
of
individuals
(
a
empire
or
dictatorship
or
oppressive
government
.
)
to
a
certain
extent
,
you
have
to
identify
the
motive
driving
your
position
,
whether
it
be
fear
of
our
government
or
trust
in
our
government
,
and
determine
the
extent
to
which
that
motive
might
be
hindering
your
ability
to
critically
evaluate
the
opposing
argument
fairly
in
light
of
your
own
.
personally
,
i
do
n't
think
banning
the
purchase
and
use
of
firearms
in
the
united
states
will
do
anything
to
lessen
the
crime
rates
in
our
country
.
as
has
been
stated
already
in
this
forum
,
the
gun
market
will
continue
regardless
of
federal
policy
.
also
,
we
've
nurtured
a
culture
of
hopelessness
and
violence
in
our
country
that
(
while
it
may
not
be
root
cause
of
the
problem
)
has
certainly
not
helped
the
conditions
that
drive
a
person
to
resort
to
violent
recourse
to
deal
or
cope
with
certain
circumstances
where
better
opportunities
,
financial
security
,
or
a
better
education
might
help
them
to
make
more
responsible
decisions
.
i
realize
that
i
'm
being
horribly
idealistic
here
(
as
i
'm
often
accused
of
being
)
but
i
feel
that
a
better
public
education
system
,
a
more
dynamic
economy
,
and
a
more
promising
future
for
the
people
of
our
country
will
do
much
more
than
taking
the
guns
out
of
all
the
sock
drawers
in
the
u.
s.
of
a.
and
,
the
argument
that
it
works
in
britain
fails
to
address
the
geographical
size
difference
between
north
america
and
the
british
isles
,
the
demographic
diversity
,
the
population
counts
,
and
the
cultural
conflicts
that
distinguish
the
two
nations
.
tighter
restrictions
on
gun
purchases
and
ownership
are
definitely
necessary
.
a
ban
is
not
.
<new_line>
guns
are
n't
needed
on
the
daily
by
people
outside
of
the
armed
forces
so
i
really
do
n't
see
a
need
for
us
carrying
guns
.
it
only
leads
to
violence
and
gangbanging
anyways
...
besides
,
i
remember
reading
once
that
in
the
countries
that
had
banned
guns
and
an
over
90
%
less
deaths
to
weaponry
than
in
the
u.s
.
now
that
says
something
.
<new_line>
yea
,
but
only
if
you
'd
kill
someone
with
it
.
it
's
a
good
decoration
item
!
<new_line>
finally
.
someone
who
pointed
out
that
violent
crimes
in
europe
are
higher
.
good
lord
.
stop
listening
to
propaganda
.
in
fact
bbc
recently
did
a
report
on
how
crime
has
gotten
worse
.
get
y'alls
head
out
of
the
sand
.
europe
's
moving
away
from
government
intervention
.
were
moving
toward
it
.
europe
's
starting
to
realize
that
gun
control
fails
.
were
moving
towards
it
.
why
do
we
not
look
across
the
pond
and
realize
how
much
it
sucks
?
high
crime
,
and
high
unemployment
.
<new_line>
outlaw
guns
,
then
only
outlaws
will
have
guns
.
<new_line>
not
to
change
subject
but
to
show
a
comparison
lets
ban
large
vehicle
's
truck
's
cars
pickups
and
anything
that
has
a
engine
larger
than
a
single
cylinder
and
go
's
faster
than
5
miles
per
hour
because
they
kill
people
more
so
than
guns
.
but
that
is
a
infringement
on
my
liberty
what
liberty
the
pursuit
of
life
,
liberty
,
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
.
that
do
n't
matter
people
are
to
careless
to
drive
such
a
large
and
fast
vehicle
.
and
criminals
use
them
to
get
away
and
to
kill
people
with
it
and
kids
can
get
in
them
and
go
joy
riding
and
hurt
a
lot
of
people
.
under
age
kids
do
n't
have
a
license
to
drive
them
and
some
adults
do
n't
either
and
still
they
drive
even
if
it
is
against
the
law
and
some
parents
let
there
kids
drive
anyway
to
go
to
the
store
or
what
ever
the
law
has
gotten
more
strict
but
it
still
go
's
on
and
so
dose
drunk
driven
and
a
lot
of
other
thing
like
drugs
,
theft
,
prostitution
,
gambling
and
so
on
and
i
do
n't
see
stopping
people
having
weapons
or
anything
elise
it
will
just
make
thing
worse
not
better
responsibility
and
accountability
is
the
next
best
thing
.
anything
that
was
tried
to
stop
has
just
got
worse
i
'm
not
saying
make
it
legal
for
like
drugs
or
anything
like
that
but
something
ai
n't
working
right
.
even
when
the
gun
law
was
in
affect
the
bad
guys
still
get
there
han
's
on
them
just
a
few
years
ago
in
california
the
cops
had
a
shoot
out
and
the
bad
guy
's
had
band
full
auto
weapons
and
bullet
proof
vest
the
cop
's
were
out
gunned
and
out
matched
so
if
you
want
to
ban
all
weapons
because
of
safety
then
you
might
as
well
ban
all
things
that
are
not
safe
.
we
all
take
life
in
our
on
hands
when
we
drive
a
car
ride
a
four
wheeler
motorcycle
flying
in
plane
's
water
skying
boating
rock
climbing
hiking
anything
any
where
any
time
you
just
do
n't
know
your
no
safer
with
out
them
that
s
for
sure
and
i
believe
that
if
i
'm
responsible
enough
to
fight
for
our
country
then
i
have
the
right
to
have
any
firearm
i
want
.
just
as
you
have
the
right
to
any
vehicle
or
anything
like
that
as
long
as
your
responsible
for
your
actions
and
safety
of
all
around
you
.
now
if
you
want
to
go
jump
off
a
crane
with
a
rubber
band
tied
to
your
foot
that
s
on
you
or
skydive
motor
cross
and
so
on
.
i
try
not
to
tell
other
people
how
to
live
and
i
expected
the
same
.
but
to
tell
me
i
do
n't
have
the
right
to
have
a
weapon
that
is
controlling
my
life
and
other
's
that
believe
in
the
right
to
have
them
that
are
law
abiding
people
.
and
as
i
said
i
served
my
country
as
a
lot
of
others
here
did
and
continue
to
do
for
you
and
every
one
here
in
the
u.s.a
.
 
p.s
this
is
not
directed
toured
any
one
person
or
person
's
here
or
anywhere
on
this
forum
its
just
my
opinion
about
banning
or
gun
control
if
a
person
wants
to
harm
you
and
there
is
no
weapons
to
steal
or
bye
on
the
black
market
he
will
make
it
.
and
a
good
example
is
a
water
pipe
shot
gun
or
other
type
's
of
ballistic
weapon
if
you
do
n't
think
so
look
it
up
and
there
's
a
whole
lot
more
things
that
can
be
made
to
kill
with
if
they
want
what
you
have
.
look
on
you
tube
for
home
made
weapons
and
explosive
and
you
will
see
how
easy
it
is
to
do
.
so
just
banning
weapons
wo
n't
work
if
your
a
bad
guy
.
think
about
it
and
a
lot
of
the
thing
are
common
things
you
can
get
every
day
at
the
hardware
store
and
store
's
off
the
shelf
.
and
a
lot
of
the
people
on
you
tube
that
are
doing
it
is
kid
's
the
one
's
that
get
hurt
the
most
because
lack
of
guidance
from
adults
and
no
supervision
.
and
its
because
the
ban
of
explosives
and
homemade
firearms
.
to
them
its
illegal
and
exciting
and
dangerous.well
i
said
about
all
i
'm
going
to
say
.
this
is
to
all
that
believes
in
god
i
hope
he
will
bless
all
of
you
and
your
's
may
he
bring
peace
in
your
hart
's
and
keep
you
well
.
and
to
those
who
do
n't
i
still
wish
you
well
be
good
and
safe
in
what
ever
you
do
in
life
.
<new_line>
no
if
you
have
a
guns
license
<new_line>
absolutely
they
should
be
banned
.
there
are
almost
no
cases
where
an
innocent
person
has
defended
themselves
with
a
gun
.
and
sure
guns
do
n't
kill
people
,
but
the
death
rate
would
definately
go
down
if
people
did
not
have
easy
access
to
weapons
.
i
mean
look
at
the
vt
incident
.
a
college
kid
,
with
a
clearly
bad
background
record
,
managed
to
buy
guns
and
ammo
.
we
outlaw
gun
's
and
stuff
like
that
does
not
happen
<new_line>
if
a
robber
came
in
your
house
you
would
want
a
gun
.
<new_line>
as
long
as
people
who
have
guns
use
they
responsibly
they
should
never
be
banned
<new_line>
no
guns
should
not
be
baned
in
america
and
no
we
should
not
be
able
2
carry
fully
automatic
,
but
if
a
person
tries
to
hurt
you
or
your
family
unless
you
are
a
sharpshooter
then
a
single
shot
wepon
will
not
be
good
enough
to
protect
you
or
your
family
.
so
a
semi
-
automatic
wepon
can
be
good
to
have
around
the
house
.
<new_line>
guns
should
be
banned
everywhere
except
america
.
<new_line>
shot
guns
are
used
for
many
different
application
a
few
of
which
are
bird
hunting
like
pheasant
or
ducks
,
they
can
also
be
used
for
trap
and
skeet
shooting
.
another
thing
shotguns
have
a
maximum
shot
distance
of
30
yards
so
they
are
n't
that
good
of
a
weapon
.
also
semi
-
automatic
weapons
have
various
uses
and
when
you
are
hunting
fast
animals
you
want
to
be
able
to
take
as
many
shots
as
possible
without
having
to
cock
the
gun
.
another
point
is
that
a
gun
is
a
tool
and
the
person
is
the
one
who
kills
someone
not
the
gun
.
and
it
is
now
required
to
take
firearm
safety
to
purchase
or
use
a
gun
and
also
80
%
of
guns
used
in
crimes
are
bought
illegally
according
to
the
fbi
.
<new_line>
well
if
guns
were
banned
stupid
people
would
not
be
able
to
get
the
guns
and
kill
the
other
people.yeah
,
maybe
you
did
not
see
when
you
wrote
the
"
stupid
people
with
"
part
.
ban
the
damn
things
ban
them
all
.
<new_line>
yes
because
some
people
in
america
can
not
be
trusted
with
one
i
understand
that
if
its
for
your
protection
then
yeah
go
ahead
and
have
one
but
i
'm
just
saying
most
crimes
happen
with
handguns
.
<new_line>
and
freedom
can
be
lost
with
guns
in
the
wrong
hands
.
it
works
both
way
.
<new_line>
guns
are
illegal
in
chicago
.
how
do
you
explain
chicago
having
the
highest
homicide
rate
?
do
n't
worry
...
i
'll
wait
.
<new_line>
where
'd
you
read
that
?
the
nra
newsletter
?
highest
gun
related
death
per

:
dc
,
where

link
lowest
gun

per

:
hawaii
,
where

link
and
see
xaeon
's
arguement
below
.
chicago
is
like
15
on
the
list
.
link
and
considering
the
poverty
rate
,
and
that
it
's
the
3rd
largest
city
(
and
probably
the
second
most
dense
)
that
's
actually
not
bad
.
<new_line>
guns
do
nt
kill
people
,
people
kill
people
.
people
sometimes
kill
other
people
innocently
a
lower
percentage
of
the
time
but
yes
it
is
there
.
it
is
called
self
defense
.
if
someone
breaks
into
your
house
and
you
shoot
and
kill
that
man
is
that
a
bad
thing
?
also
if
it
is
not
guns
then
it
will
be
homemade
bombs
or
just
kitchen
knives
.
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
ban
just
like
the
alchohol
ban
the
us
gov
tried
.
it
wo
nt
work
in
the
southern
states
i
gurantee
it
.
most
of
the
16
year
olds
and
higher
that
i
know
own
a
gun
.
at
least
25
%
of
them
.
which
means
that
they
are
already
toting
illegaly
so
if
they
are
already
how
is
the
gov
gon
na
enforce
it
if
they
are
already
having
kids
slip
under
the
radar
?
<new_line>
you
can
kill
someone
with
a
car
,
should
cars
be
banned
in
america
?
<new_line>
key
word
:
 
yeah
its
possible
for
a
maniac
to
get
ahold
of
a
gun
,
but
its
also
possible
for
a
maniac
to
get
in
the
drivers
seat
of
a
car
.
(
see
my
post
)
perhaps
we
should
ban
cars
in
america
?
<new_line>
i
meant
that
i
wanted
guns
to
be
kept
in
the
right
hands
.
i
did
not
mean
that
i
wanted
guns
to
be
banned
.
<new_line>
actually
,
no
i
would
n't
.
if
a
robber
came
into
my
house
in
an
area
where
gun
ownership
is
legal
,
i
'd
have
to
seriously
consider
whether
or
not
this
person
is
also
going
to
have
a
gun
;
why
would
they
enter
my
house
unarmed
if
they
knew
that
chances
were
that
i
would
have
a
gun
?
all
this
is
going
to
do
is
cause
a
shootout
,
with
most
likely
someone
(
50
%
chance
it
's
me
)
getting
shot
.
i
'd
rather
hand
over
my
stuff
(
it
's
just
stuff
)
,
claim
on
the
insurance
afterwards
and
have
a
greatly
reduced
risk
of
ending
up
dead
.
<new_line>
oh
,
that
s
cool
,
i
agree
.
sorry
bout
that
.
<new_line>
no
they
should
n't
.
if
you
take
away
the
civilian
's
only
right
to
self
defense
,
how
are
they
suppose
to
defend
themselves
from
the
criminals
who
buy
weapons
and
drugs
from
the
black
market
illegally
.
if
you
think
homicide
rates
are
high
now
,
if
gun
control
becomes
active
,
that
will
sky
rocket
.
<new_line>
uhhh
?
you
ever
heard
of
a
black
market
,
the
illegal
selling
,
buying
,
and
distribution
of
contraband
(
weapons
,
drugs
)
illegally
?
<new_line>
do
you
realize
your
talking
about
empires
,
which
existed
hundreds
of
years
ago
,
when
there
were
n't
"
hardcore
"
gangsters
and
a
black
market
,
people
abided
by
the
rules
or
would
nt
have
life
.
<new_line>
in
case
you
different
do
other
research
,
chicago
has
one
of
the
highest
crime
rates
in
the
entire
country
.
crime
rates
equals
criminals
which
means
if
guns
are
illegal
,
they
must
be
getting
them
from
somewhere
,
hmmm
,
i
wonder
where
,
black
market
or
illegal
selling
across
borders
anyone
?
<new_line>
i
find
your
argument
inadequate
,
circumstantial
and
irrelevant
,
comparing
overall
homicide
rates
to
"
gun
related
"
deaths
.
chicago
is
15
on
the
list
because
it
's
sorted
alphabetically
...
:/
btw
,
hawaii
's
figures
rival
those
of
chicago
according
to
that
same
list
.
of
course
the
lowest
gun
related
deaths
will
be
in
the
the
states
where
guns
are
banned
,
duh
.
lowest
bun
not
nonexistent
.
dc
's
highest
gun
deaths
per
capita
coincidences
with
the
fact
that
guns
are
legal
there
,
does
n't
mean
anywhere
guns
are
legal
crime
rates
will
be
high
.
plus
the
dc
area
has
fewer
population
so
the
'
per
capita
'
figure
will
naturally
tend
to
be
higher
.
still
it
does
nothing
to
counter
mburke12
's
argument
.
<new_line>
actually
,
if
you
read
the
chart
i
gave
you
,
you
'll
see
that
chicago
is
ranked
15th
.
no
,
that
's
not
just
the
order
it
is
listed
in
.
burke
's
arguement
is
specifically
that
places
where
guns
are
illegal
has
more
gun
deaths
.
that
's
his
arguement
.
that
's
the
arguement
i
answered
.
that
chart
shows
conclusively
that
the
opposite
is
true
.
the
graph
is
based
on
per
capita
,
so
that
dc
has
less
people
is
completely
irrevelant
.
you
do
know
what
per
capita
means
do
n't
you
?
that
means
it
's
taking
into
consideration
the
population
.
you
are
just
going
to
have
to
face
the
fact
that
places
where
guns
are
legal
,
have
more
gun
related
deaths
.
that
's
the
arguement
burke
put
forth
.
that
's
the
arguement
i
rebutted
.
and
the
facts
show
conclusively
that
i
am
correct
.
i
'm
not
sure
what
your
arguement
is
at
all
.
<new_line>
we
need
guns
!
!
how
else
are
we
gon
na
shoot
people
that
do
nt
agree
with
us
!
!
<new_line>
pure
genius
!
!
!
!
!
!
!
!
<new_line>
shut
up
you
commie
before
i
show
you
what
a
responsible
gun
owner
can
do
!
!
!
you#%&@%
<new_line>
no
,
firearms
are
simply
made
available
for
self
-
defense
,
the
percentage
of
people
that
use
them
for
other
purposes
is
a
very
small
one
.
except
in
l.a
.
hehe
<new_line>
yes
guns
should
be
banned
in
america
.
in
the
uk
,
deaths
by
guns
are
a
lot
lower
.
the
reason
is
that
it
's
still
harder
for
the
average
man
in
the
street
to
obtain
a
gun
.
the
american
constitution
states
"
the
right
to
bear
arms
"
and
the
americans
seem
to
feel
really
strongly
about
protecting
this
right
.
obviosly
the
constitution
is
held
in
high
esteem
to
the
americans
,
based
on
their
history
and
pride
of
independence
.
however
you
ca
n't
hold
onto
values
and
laws
that
have
lost
their
importance
or
value
.
at
the
time
of
the
american
declaration
of
independance
,
which
,
i
imagine
would
have
led
to
the
drawing
up
of
the
rules
in
the
constitution
,
life
and
times
were
completely
different
.
shootings
and
murder
were
everywhere
,
and
if
i
was
george
washington
writing
a
proclamation
for
a
new
world
,
then
it
makes
perfect
sense
to
give
the
citizens
of
this
new
world
,
the
right
to
defend
their
land
,
property
,
and
life
.
and
for
this
reasons
americans
have
guns
.
but
,
if
you
ca
n't
get
hold
of
one
,
you
ca
n't
kill
someone
with
it
.
it
's
a
simple
argument
really
,
guns
kill
.
<new_line>
guns
should
be
banned
and
there
will
be
extremely
low
cases
of
gun
related
murder
.
if
guns
over
the
world
is
banned
,
we
will
get
world
peace
for
a
while
.
<new_line>
wrong
!
last
year
2.5
million
people
were
saved
by
using
a
gun
for
self
defense
.
i
do
n't
consider
that
"
almost
no
cases
where
an
innocent
person
has
defended
themselves
.
"
<new_line>
have
you
actually
read
the
newspaper
?
there
are
several
cases
and
some
that
a
gun
prevented
them
from
being
a
dead
victim
.
i
speak
from
experience
.
as
for
the
easy
access
of
guns
,
criminals
would
have
access
to
guns
in
the
black
market
regardless
if
they
banned
guns
.
cocaine
is
illegal
but
some
how
people
still
gain
access
to
it
...
well
,
how
does
that
happen
?
<new_line>
for
all
of
you
who
want
guns
to
be
illegal
ask
your
self
this
what
will
our
army
do
without
guns
.
oh
i
know
they
will
spit
at
eachother
.
its
funny
how
quick
people
are
to
say
lets
make
guns
illegal
because
their
bad
are
they
really
that
bad
last
time
i
checked
it
takes
two
hands
a
finger
and
a
willing
person
to
use
it
.
just
like
how
ignorant
people
say
pit
bulls
are
a
deadly
dog
and
should
all
be
extermanated
well
so
are
bear
and
lions
and
tigers
.
its
not
the
animal
that
was
trained
to
kill
people
.
people
train
dogs
to
kill
people
.
now
if
this
were
a
math
equation
people
added
to
killing
equalls
people
killing
people
hence
the
saying
guns
do
nt
kill
people
,
people
kill
people
.
tell
me
i
m
wrong
and
ill
call
you
and
idot
there
is
no
argument
for
that
statement
none
.
ignorance
is
what
makes
stupid
and
somtimes
i
see
too
much
of
it
.
california
is
the
best
place
for
it
.
<new_line>
just
people
kill
people
.
children
would
not
wonder
what
a
gun
does
if
they
are
exposed
to
guns
and
people
tell
them
the
proper
way
to
use
them
.
its
the
children
who
are
shielded
from
guns
that
try
to
play
with
them
and
do
n't
know
what
to
do
,
that
cause
trouble
.
<new_line>
...
oops
,
this
is
an
accidental
post
,
my
argument
is
up
there
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<new_line>
probama
it
would
still
happen
you
f*ing
moron
if
they
are
nt
afraid
of
going
to
prison
for
killing
people
they
definately
would
nt
be
afraid
to
get
a
gun
illegaly
.
<new_line>
even
if
guns
were
banned
poeple
could
still
make
there
own
guns
.
<new_line>
look
at
some
european
countries
that
banned
guns
.
guess
what
nothing
has
changed
.
if
people
want
to
kill
they
will
and
they
will
find
a
way
to
get
a
gun
to
do
so
!
so
you
want
to
get
rid
of
hunting
,
which
is
a
trillion
$
a
year
industry
and
if
you
ban
guns
millions
of
jobs
would
be
lost
.
you
think
we
are
in
a
recession
now
!
you
idiot
!
<new_line>
hunting
and
self
-
defense
,
time
to
look
past
your
little
inner
city
cocoon
.
there
is
a
big
place
called
the
rest
of
north
america
!
<new_line>
well
look
at
prohibtion
in
1919
and
on
,
also
known
as
the
volstead
act
.
alcohol
was
completely
banned
yet
everybody
still
drank
.
they
found
ways
to
drink
.
people
had
to
brew
underground
,
and
drink
in
underground
bars
,
but
it
happened
.
even
major
authorities
including
police
and
judges
were
found
down
there
.
the
same
things
would
happen
with
guns
,
and
who
would
be
the
people
to
illegally
own
guns
?
not
harmless
hunters
,
but
gangsters
and
other
criminals
who
are
dangerous
with
such
weapons
.
it
is
still
going
to
happen
.
maybe
we
just
need
tighter
gun
laws
when
purchasing
them
.
<new_line>
[
event
]
the
society
with
no
guns
has
five
members
that
buy
guns
from
the
black
market
,
they
take
over
the
society
and
create
a
dictatorship
where
the
men
are
forced
into
slave
labor
camps
and
the
women
are
sold
as
sex
slaves
.
meanwhile
the
other
society
is
fine
they
have
had
a
few
disputes
with
a
bad
apple
or
two
but
they
were
both
resolved
without
the
collapse
of
the
society
.
[
/event
]
coming
back
to
the
planet
earth
you
must
first
accept
that
guns
exist
.
if
you
ban
them
there
will
still
be
a
black
market
,
no
matter
if
they
are
smuggled
or
made
domestically
.
so
the
best
solution
is
to
regulate
and
make
sure
law
abiding
citizens
can
buy
guns
.

banning
guns
will
not
make
gun
-
related
deaths
decline
substantially
.
the
majority
of
gun
buyers
are
law
-
abiding
people
who
keep
the
guns
for
self
defense
.
guns
used
in
street
crimes
,
especially
from
gangs
,
are
typically
illegal
.
if
guns
are
banned
,
the
illegal
street
guns
will
still
be
circulated
,
but
the
innocent
people
will
not
be
able
to
obtain
a
gun
for
self
-
defense
.
<new_line>
i
'm
a
damn
hippie
,
i
suppose
,
since
i
support
extremely
strict
gun
regulation
.
but
the
keyword
there
is
regulation
.
making
guns
illegal
would
just
lead
to
more
underground
dealings
,
making
it
easy
for
any
common
criminal
to
obtain
a
gun
without
being
registered
as
a
gun
owner
and
without
having
a
gun
license
.
while
some
cases
of
this
still
occur
,
it
would
be
far
more
frequent
without
government
regulation
.
<new_line>
should
[
citizen
]
guns
be
banned
?
-
hell
no
.
in
an
arguement
made
by
t.s
.
eggleston
,
if
guns
were
banned
,
a
black
market
would
arise
as
well
as
gun
smuggling
.
this
in
return
would
lead
to
an
increase
in
crime
and
honestly
,
who
wants
more
crime
?
he
states
that
the
citizens
with
no
previous
criminal
records
would
surrender
their
guns
to
officials
,
leaving
them
helpless
and
at
a
higher
risk
for
being
injured
.
eggleston
further
explains
that
"
criminals
will
always
continue
to
break
the
law
and
prey
on
the
law
-
abiding
but
disarmed
citizens
.
"
for
the
previous
arguements
that
claim
"
there
are
almost
no
cases
where
an
innocent
person
has
defended
themselves
with
a
gun
.
"
that
s
bull
.
according
to
eggleston
and
other
statistics
,
"
every
13
seconds
,
an
american
uses
a
legal
firearm
in
defense
against
a
criminal
.
"
so
,
for
self
-
protection
,
guns
should
remain
legal
.
it
prevents
overcrowding
of
prisons
,
riots
,
and
decreases
many
injuries
.
in
return
health
costs
are
not
forced
to
sky
-
rocket
.
to
suit
the
people
that
believe
guns
should
be
completely
illegal
....
i
do
feel
that
stricter
laws
need
to
be
enforced
to
acquire
such
equipment
.
according
to
the
national
rifle
association
(
nraila
)
,
in
the
state
of
texas
,
an
individual
does
not
need
a
permit
to
buy
a
hangun
,
and
they
are
not
required
to
carry
registration
or
a
license
.
this
lack
of
legislation
is
one
of
the
main
reasons
for
the
decrease
in
gun
safety
,
so
if
we
fix
this
,
americans
can
be
on
their
way
to
a
happy
,
gun
legal
society
.

guns
save
lives
!
if
we
were
to
ban
guns
the
only
people
that
will
have
guns
are
the
people
we
were
trying
to
take
them
away
from
.
people
already
are
able
to
get
guns
illegally
and
will
continue
to
if
they
are
banned
.
i
will
always
feel
safer
with
a
gun
knowing
that
criminals
can
get
guns
illegally
.
<new_line>
if
we
outlaw
guns
that
stuff
will
still
happen
because
they
are
already
illegally
getting
guns
.
<new_line>
guns
kill
peope
;
just
like
spoons
made
rosie
o'donnel
fat
.
<new_line>
one
of
the
many
reasons
those
men
signed
the
declaration
of
independence
.
<new_line>
ever
since
we
put
registration
on
guns
and
making
guns
harder
to
get
school
shooting
started
.
we
need
to
allow
students
to
carry
concealed
guns
on
campus
.
with
the
vt
shooting
if
one
student
had
been
allowed
to
carry
a
gun
on
them
the
shooter
would
have
ended
it
early
and
many
people
would
still
be
alive
today
.
it
needs
to
be
a
law
that
we
enforce
to
make
every
home
have
at
least
on
gun
to
protect
your
self
<new_line>
ok
so
i
think
thtas
the
guns
do
nt
kill
people
kill
the
guns
well
they
just
happen
to
be
in
between
the
people
<new_line>
1,145
times
a
day
handguns
are
used
against
robbers
.
416
times
each
day
women
use
their
handguns
to
protect
themselves
from
rapists
.
overall
,
a
gun
in
the
home
is
216
times
more
likely
to
be
used
in
self
defense
than
to
cause
the
death
of
an
innocent
victim
.
and
even
if
you
do
n't
own
a
gun
,
preserving
the
right
of
your
neighbors
to
own
them
is
one
of
the
best
ways
to
keep
criminals
out
of
your
neighborhood
.
<new_line>
so
let
me
get
this
straight
...
home
invasions
almost
always
means
that
they
are
just
there
for
your
stuff
,
that
means
that
they
are
not
going
to
rape
your
wife
and
daughter
in
front
of
you
while
you
're
tied
to
a
chair
then
kill
all
3
of
you
after
they
get
their
kicks
then
take
your
stuff
?
uh
,
who
's
going
to
collect
the
insurance
?
probably
whoever
is
not
at
home
durring
that
time
i
guess
,
or
some
other
family
members
currently
not
living
there
right
?
<new_line>
actually
,
yes
.
thousands
of
burglaries
happen
every
day
,
and
i
'm
sure
in
a
lot
of
cases
they
happen
when
people
are
at
home
.
there
are
not
,
however
,
thousands
of
the
scenario
you
described
.
so
,
yes
,
home
invasion
almost
always
means
that
they
are
there
for
your
stuff
.
 
if
they
were
to
burgle
my
house
,
then
me
.
i
'd
buy
some
nice
shiny
new
shit
,
and
enjoy
it
knowing
that
i
did
n't
get
shot
in
the
face
because
i
tried
to
be
a
hero
.
<new_line>
i
do
not
think
all
guns
should
be
banned
,
but
certainly
some
.
if
your
a
hunter
and
you
want
to
kill
a
deer
,
then
go
and
by
a
rifle
,
but
do
you
really
need
an
ak-47
to
kill
a
little
deer
?
and
if
your
buying
a
gun
for
protection
,
then
that
is
just
stupid
.
there
are
plenty
of
things
you
can
do
before
resorting
to
a
gun
for
protection
.
get
a
guard
dog
,
buy
an
alarm
,
or
move
near
a
place
with
a
lower
crime
rate
.
you
could
also
buy
a
taser
or
pepper
spray
.
<new_line>
guns
do
n't
kill
people
.
people
kill
people
.
guns
assist
people
.
<new_line>
studies
have
shown
(
look
at
cities
in
australia
)
that
when
you
disarm
a
population
crime
rates
go
up
because
people
no
longer
have
the
fear
of
people
defending
themselves
.
<new_line>
any
of
u
frix
ever
heard
of
the
black
market
?
?
?
sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
!
<new_line>
itz
gud
4
everybody
cuz
it
helps

alot
on
eveyry
problem
u
gt
no
matter
wat
<new_line>
guns
do
n't
kill
people
,
poeple
kill
people
.
the
vast
majority
of
people
who
commit
gun
crimes
obtain
their
wepons
illegally
in
the
first
place
,
so
if
guns
are
taken
from
the
law
abideing
citizens
,
you
'll
have
a
situation
where
the
outlaws
will
have
guns
and
the
sane
people
who
should
be
allowed
to
have
guns
will
be
defenseless
.
also
it
shifts
the
balance
of
power
in
favor
of
the
politicians
instead
of
the
citizenry
.
it
's
just
one
more
step
towards
tyranny
.
this
country
started
by
shooting
the
poeple
who
tried
to
supress
us
.
we
ca
n't
allow
our
government
to
become
the
very
thing
we
killed
to
escape
from
in
the
first
place
.
do
you
really
want
the
politicians
to
have
complete
control
of
you
lives
?
<new_line>
banning
guns
would
n't
bring
down
gun
violence
significantly
because
people
who
are
committing
gun
crimes
are
getting
their
guns
illegally
in
the
first
place
.
and
other
countries
that
have
banned
guns
have
alot
more
variables
to
consider
besides
just
banning
guns
alone
.
most
other
countries
have
a
much
tighter
justice
system
that
does
n't
give
any
wiggle
room
for
crimes
in
general
let
alone
gun
crimes
.
<new_line>
way
more
people
are
killed
each
year
by
car
crashes
than
by
gun
violence
.
should
we
ban
cars
too
?
<new_line>
that
is
completely
ridiculous
.
if
guns
were
banned
,
people
would
get
the
elsewhere
(
ever
heard
of
the
black
market
?
?
?
)
and
the
law
abiding
citizens
would
be
defenseless
.
and
world
peace
?
?
?
there
is
no
way
that
's
possible
right
now
no
matter
what
you
ban
.
guns
are
not
the
only
way
violence
is
carried
out
.
do
your
research
.
<new_line>
the
second
amendment
was
nt
for
people
to
start
killing
each
other
,
it
was
for
the
creation
of
the
militia
.
guns
in
america
,
are
supposed
to
keep
this
world
a
better
place
,
however
,
it
does
nt
do
that
at
all
,
it
only
allows
criminals
to
commit
crimes
.
it
definetly
does
nt
protect
anyone
from
anything
,
it
only
harms
the
people
of
this
country
.
and
yea
,
i
get
that
many
people
save
themselves
from
the
criminals
that
break
into
their
house
or
try
to
rape
them
,
but
half
the
time
that
s
not
the
case
.

i
do
n't
understand
why
people
think
that
by
guns
being
banned
in
america
would
reduce
crime
?
of
course
it
wo
n't
stop
crime
because
criminals
are
not
going
to
go
buy
a
gun
legally
anyway
,
but
rather
from
the
back
of
the
van
.
large
majority
of
gun
owners
do
not
like
the
idea
of
the
background
check
,
which
in
my
opinion
does
is
a
very
good
.
i
had
a
background
check
when
i
purchased
my
gun
and
no
problems
at
all
.
i
have
absolutely
no
problem
with
that
.
of
course
,
it
wo
n't
stop
criminals
completely
,
but
at
least
it
will
reduce
the
number
of
those
who
should
not
own
guns
.
in
addition
,
criminals
will
think
twice
about
harming
someone
when
you
live
in
a
state
where
the
gun
laws
are
not
so
strict
........
and
no
,
i
am
not
a
nra
member
nor
do
i
ever
wish
to
be
one
.
<new_line>
if
someone
breaks
into
a
home
the
homeowner
almost
always
has
the
advantage
.
they
know
the
layout
of
their
house
better
than
whoever
is
breaking
in
.
when
it
comes
to
real
-
life
applications
the
chances
of
you
geting
shot
are
way
less
than
50
-
50
.
look
it
up
<new_line>
guns
do
n't
kill
people
.
people
kill
people
.
so
you
guys
think
that
since
guns
kill
people
,
we
should
ban
those
,
right
?
knives
kill
people
too
,
should
they
be
banned
?
we
cut
our
meat
with
knives
so
no
.
we
kill
animals
and
eat
their
meat
with
guns
so
no
we
should
n't
ban
guns
.
<new_line>
yes
of
course!!guns
might
hurt
people
or
even
kill
people!the
point
is
:
u
can
not
control
the
ones
actually
have
guns!they
will
hurt
people
when
they
want!!they
will
use
their
guns!!if
u
do
n't
ban
it
,
what
is
the
use
of
police??they
trained
to
be
strong
and
catch
the
thieves
...
now
,
all
americans
got
guns
..
even
police
can
not
stop
them
from
stealing
..
(because
they
got
guns
either)
...
so
how
can
we
let
the
americans
hurt
people
by
using
guns
again
and
again
?
<new_line>
"
the
british
are
n't
going
to
invade
,
so
we
do
n't
need
to
protect
ourselves
"
.
so
when
an
american
enters
you
're
home
with
intent
to
kill
,
are
you
going
to
defend
yourself
with
a
fork
?
i
do
agree
that
most
burglary
's
that
occur
do
not
involve
a
murder
or
serious
injury
,
but
not
all
home
invasion
's
are
with
the
intent
to
remove
your
property
.
if
i
we
're
in
the
position
to
put
my
life
on
the
line
,
or
lose
a
television
,
i
would
rather
lose
the
television
.
the
question
is
whether
this
person
is
here
to
steal
my
property
or
harm
me
or
my
family
.
i
would
rather
have
the
means
to
protect
myself
and
my
family
.
if
we
lived
in
a
perfect
world
where
we
did
n't
have
poverty
,
drugs
and
poor
education
,
then
maybe
i
could
see
you
re
point
.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
we
do
n't
.
when
america
gets
to
the
point
where
i
can
go
to
sleep
at
night
,
or
even
go
about
my
daily
business
and
not
worry
,
then
i
'll
consider
getting
rid
of
my
gun
.
until
then
,
we
live
in
a
dangerous
world
where
people
live
outside
the
law
and
i
feel
safe
knowing
there
s
an
amendment
granting
me
the
right
to
defend
myself
.
<new_line>
guns
do
nt
kill
people
,
people
kill
people
,
from
a
gunsdont
kill
people
i
do
corperation
<new_line>
i
do
n't
think
we
should
ban
all
guns
,
but
certainly
some
.
if
you
want
to
hunt
,
then
go
ahead
a
buy
a
hunting
rifle
,
but
what
if
the
purpose
of
a
gun
other
then
that
.
getting
one
for
protection
is
stupid
since
there
are
many
other
options
you
have
before
resorting
to
a
gun
for
protection
.
think
about
getting
an
alarm
,
moving
to
a
low
crime
area
,
or
buying
a
guard
dog
.
i
think
guns
such
as
ak-47
's
are
overkill
and
should
be
banned
.
do
you
really
need
a
machine
gun
to
kill
a
little
deer
?
<new_line>
i
do
not
think
all
guns
should
be
banned
,
but
certainly
some
.
guns
used
for
hunting
are
fine
,
but
they
do
not
serve
any
purpose
other
then
that
.
guns
such
as
ak-47
's
should
be
band
because
they
are
overkill
.
do
you
really
need
a
machine
gun
to
kill
a
little
deer
.
kind
of
like
how
some
knives
such
as
switchblades
are
banned
because
they
serve
little
purpose
.
<new_line>
not
exactly
disagreeing
with
your
argument
,
but
guns
can
also
be
used
for
personal
safety
.
not
just
for
killing
"
little
deer
"
.
<new_line>
the
are
plenty
of
things
you
can
do
before
resorting
to
a
gun
for
safety
.
i
have
said
this
many
times
.
move
to
a
place
with
a
low
crime
rate
,
get
an
alarm
,
or
buy
a
guard
dog
.
you
could
also
buy
a
taser
or
pepper
spray
.
buying
a
gun
for
protection
is
just
stupid
and
paranoid
.
who
would
you
even
be
protecting
yourself
from
anyway
?
a
burglar
,
because
most
burglaries
occur
when
your
not
even
home
,
make
the
gun
pointless
.
<new_line>
everybody
is
talking
about
how
the
government
is
going
to
take
over
,
and
guns
will
be
the
only
way
to
protect
ourselves
.
it
sounds
like
some
bad
movie
premise
.
how
has
the
government
taken
over
exactly
,
and
what
is
so
bad
if
it
did
?
i
mean
is
n't
a
nation
supposed
to
be
run
by
a
government
?
if
we
were
under
the
control
of
a
tyrant
,
then
i
could
understand
,
but
we
live
in
a
democracy
.
we
choose
our
leaders
,
and
can
impeach
them
if
we
do
not
like
them
.
it
is
not
a
perfect
system
i
know
,
but
it
ensures
that
no
person
can
take
control
of
our
country
.
even
if
somebody
did
,
then
do
you
really
think
a
gun
is
going
to
be
you
saving
grace
?
if
there
was
a
so
called
tyrant
,
then
he
probably
has
taken
over
the
militia
,
and
do
you
think
that
you
would
win
against
a
trained
solider
who
probably
has
better
weapons
.
<new_line>
just
because
you
make
it
illegal
to
buy
a
gun
you
will
never
and
i
mean
never
get
all
the
guns
off
the
street
because
the
import
guns
illegally
they
buy
guns
without
ffa
regulation
and
peple
are
not
stupid
and
they
will
find
a
way
to
make
themselves
weapons
such
as
the
book
writtem
by
bill
holmes
published
in
2002
titled
.50
-
caliber
rifle
construction
manual
<new_line>
i
do
nt
even
see
it
could
come
across
the
mind
of
any
intelligent
person
that
people
who
are
innocent
do
nt
use
guns
to
defend
themselves
,
that
s
like
saying
if
someone
broke
into
your
house
to
rob
you
and
they
did
nt
know
you
were
there
that
they
would
nt
want
to
kill
you
therefore
having
a
gun
could
protect
you
from
a
scared
criminal
.
<new_line>
people
will
still
get
guns
and
what
s
going
to
happen
to
all
the
guns
all
over
the
world
.
there
will
never
be
world
peace
.
there
will
always
be
weapons
.
people
will
always
kill
other
people
.
its
as
simple
as
that
<new_line>
what
the
hell
is
balsthis
and
are
you
a
moron
because
i
feel
bad
for
you
if
you
are
but
if
your
not
then
how
the
hell
do
you
possibly
think
you
are
contributung
to
the
debate
?
<new_line>
hey
i
agree
but
where
did
you
get
your
facts
from
...............................................................
<new_line>
we
would
gain
nothing
from
banning
guns
in
america
.
guns
are
dangerous
when
people
illegally
use
them
why
would
we
ban
guns
in
america
?
to
stop
the
violence
and
all
the
killings
linked
to
them
correct
?
and
if
killing
people
is
already
illegal
what
good
is
it
going
to
do
to
make
guns
illegal
.
if
you
are
willing
to
kill
some
one
you
probably
do
n't
care
what
you
are
killing
then
with
is
legal
or
not
.
the
only
people
banning
guns
in
america
would
hurt
are
the
people
that
are
defending
there
homes
,
business
's
,
families
.
since
guns
are
already
a
lucrative
black
market
making
them
illegal
would
make
it
worst
.
just
like
banning
alcohol
did
to
this
nation
.
look
how
much
money
that
made
the
mob
it
brought
them
into
power
.
what
do
you
guys
think
a
black
market
surplus
do
?
<new_line>
i
believe
that
a
ban
on
firearms
in
america
will
result
in
widespread
protests
and
riots
,
the
gun
market
will
continue
,
people
will
no
longer
feel
secure
,
and
an
ineffective
and
possible
corrupt
system
will
be
created
that
will
only
cause
america
even
more
suffering
.
i
also
believe
that
anyone
who
says
any
type
of
regulation
on
firearms
is
against
the
2nd
amendment
is
quite
honestly
ignorant
of
the
world
we
live
in
now
.
even
greater
regulation
than
is
currently
seen
is
needed
on
the
buying
and
selling
of
firearms
.
i
mean
really
let
's
be
serious
here
,
guns
do
kill
people
.
but
they
also
protect
people
.
regulation
is
needed
to
ensure
that
guns
begin
to
do
the
latter
in
greater
degrees
.
<new_line>
guns
just
help
people
kill
each
other
but
its
not
the
guns
fault
it
has
no
control
of
its
self
people
choices
to
use
the
gun
in
crime
<new_line>
there
was
a
reason
we
the
people
created
the
2nd
ammendment
,
the
right
to
bear
arms
.
we
created
it
so
if
the
government
went
tyranical
on
the
people
,
the
people
will
have
a
way
to
defend
themsleves
and
try
to
overthrow
the
government
.
if
guns
were
banned
in
america
,
it
would
leave
the
citizens
helpless
against
the
government
.
<new_line>
all
we
need
is
good
gun
control
.
and
by
"
good
gun
control
"
i
mean
two
hands
on
the
gun
;)
<new_line>
on

<new_line>
what
's
the
government
made
of
?
people
.
what
's
the
military
made
of
?
people
.
what
's
all
of
america
made
of
?
people
.
if
we
can
trust
our
government
and
military
with
automatic
weapons
,
tanks
,
and
explosives
to
defend
our
country
,
why
is
it
we
ca
n't
rely
on
the
people
of
america
to
defend
themselves
?
there
is
only
one
cop
for
every
2000
people
in
the
u.s
.
i
believe
.
congress
itself
said
that
it
is
not
their
duty
to
defend
us
as
individuals
,
only
as
a
whole
,
which
is
unapplicable
when
it
comes
to
a
robbery
,
rape
,
or
murder
.
every
human
has
the
right
to
live
.
however
,
a
"
human
"
with
a
sick
intent
of
murdering
,
raping
,
and
maiming
with
long
list
of
such
words
,
is
hardly
what
i
would
call
a
human
.
i
call
them
a
monster
.
think
,
do
you
believe
hitler
had
a
right
to
live
?
what
about
the
911
terrorists
?
what
about
seung
-
hui
cho
,
who
laughed
as
he
shot
his
victims
at
virginia
tech
?
the
average
response
time
for
cops
is
a
minimum
of
5
minutes
,
with
no
definite
maximum
quota
.
it
only
takes
about
5
seconds
for
a
crime
to
happen
,
and
much
less
for
someone
to
be
stabbed
or
shot
to
death
.
would
n't
you
think
if
criminals
have
guns
,
you
should
in
fact
have
one
to
defend
yourself
should
you
ever
become
a
victim
?
you
anti
-
gun
people
bash
on
gun
owners
who
prey
on
the
defenseless
people
.
you
,
as
a
person
against
guns
,
are
in
fact
helpless
too
,
but
you
do
not
have
to
be
.
it
is
not
complicated
,
guns
do
not
take
superior
skill
to
use
if
they
make
murder
so
easy
.
i
'm
part
of
a
shooting
program
,
and
in
only
3
hours
they
taught
kids
as
young
as
7
how
to
safely
handle
weapons
,
and
never
in
the
50
+
years
it
's
been
around
has
there
been
an
accident
.
someone
once
told
me
,
"
if
you
give
the
criminal
what
he
wants
,
he
wo
n't
kill
you
.
"
yeah
really
,
as
if
every
criminal
was
after
your
money
.
criminals
have
different
intents
,
anywhere
from
your
money
to
your
life
.
your
life
is
a
potential
target
no
matter
what
the
intent
is
.
would
you
rather
be
mangled
,
mutilated
,
and
murdered
or
have
to
explain
why
you
shot
that
thug
in
the
chest
?
do
not
misinterpret
this
,
but
there
are
criminals
that
exist
who
do
not
wish
to
even
harm
someone
.
however
,
what
right
and
reason
would
they
have
to
steal
from
you
,
scare
you
,
threaten
your
life
,
and
maybe
even
kill
you
?
another
thing
someone
told
me
,
"
dude
you
have
no
chance
without
a
gun
,
even
with
one
you
only
have
about
a
3
%
chance
.
"
bullsh*t
.
even
if
it
really
was
a
3
%
chance
,
i
think
i
'd
rather
have
that
3
%
chance
to
live
than
nothing
,
even
the
smallest
percent
is
more
than
enough
.
if
guns
are
banned
,
do
any
of
you
think
criminals
or
"
law
abiding
"
citizens
will
abide
by
it
?
though
they
may
be
faulty
,
some
criminals
know
how
to
manufacture
their
own
guns
.
despite
being
faulty
,
they
are
still
guns
,
and
they
can
still
kill
.
therefore
,
in
a
society
with
outlawed
weapons
,
a
massive
black
market
will
arise
with
criminally
manufactured
weapons
and
weapons
that
already
exist
.
the
same
thing
is
going
on
for
marijuana
,
cocaine
,
and
meth
,
and
the
method
of
sale
and
purchase
is
no
different
for
guns
.
how
?
because
drugs
are
illegal
,
and
if
guns
are
too
,
then
they
will
just
be
circulated
the
exact
same
way
.
clearly
we
ca
n't
trust
our
the
people
and
criminals
with
guns
,
but
we
can
trust
them
to
follow
the
laws
?
we
would
ultimately
create
more
criminals
because
a
majority
of
the
90
million
gun
owners
like
myself
would
not
abide
by
it
.
if
guns
are
banned
,
it
would
n't
prevent
suicide
.
people
will
just
start
hanging
themselves
or
drive
off
a
cliff
.
i
do
n't
believe
everyone
should
have
a
gun
.
law
-
abiding
citizens
who
know
how
to
use
it
should
.
by
no
means
should
anyone
who
is
mentally
insane
,
a
felon
,
or
simply
ignorant
be
able
to
use
one
.
keep
in
mind
anti
-
gun
people
complain
about
accidents
or
tragedies
that
happen
because
someone
did
n't
know
how
to
use
a
gun
.
you
are
,
in
fact
,
one
of
those
people
who
does
not
know
how
to
use
a
gun
.
therefore
,
you
are
helpless
,
ignorant
,
and
have
no
right
to
tell
people
who
do
know
how
to
use
guns
what
to
do
.
<new_line>
semi
-
automatic
guns
shoot
single
rounds
....
so
we
ca
n't
have
pistols
but
are
allowed
to
only
used
12
gauge
pump
shotguns
or
hunting
rifles
?
<new_line>
of
course
not
it
is
our
right
as
defined
by
the
constitution
to
have
the
right
bear
arms
and
pluss
do
you
really
wan
only
people
who
got
there
guns
illegaly
to
have
them
?
?
<new_line>
this
is
a
very
flawed
point
of
view
.
for
one
,
guns
are
meant
for
self
defense
and
to
fight
wars
.
even
if
we
did
ban
guns
people
will
still
get
them
,
how
do
you
think
people
get
weed
?
keeping
guns
legal
would
keep
the
black
market
activity
down
and
with
people
without
guns
it
would
be
so
easy
to
rob
someone
's
house
.
besides
you
ca
n't
carry
a
cop
around
with
you
now
can
you
?
<new_line>
that
is
why
we
have
a
license
for
certain
guns
....
you
drive
a
car
knowing
the
risks
and
that
you
can
die
from
driving
them
,
people
still
drive
them
anyways
.
<new_line>
wow
,
if
someone
was
robbing
my
house
with
a
gun
i
would
n't
be
playing
high
noon
with
them
....
<new_line>
i
would
like
to
add
that
we
are
a
constitutional
republic
.
<new_line>
the
second
amendment
was
created
for
the
following
reasons
:
deterring
undemocratic
government
,
repelling
invasion
,
suppressing
insurrection
,
facilitating
the
natural
right
of
self
defense
,
participating
in
law
enforcement
and
slave
control
in
slave
states
(
no
longer
applicable
)
.
so
the
second
amendment
is
in
place
so
people
can
kill
other
people
under
certain
circumstances
,
that
is
of
course
what
guns
are
for
in
the
first
place
.
there
s
good
reason
why
12
year
olds
ca
n't
vote
,
or
for
that
matter
own
guns
.
<new_line>
well
if
you
would
like
more
gun
restriction
why
not
just
move
to
chicago
where
they
are
basically
banned
.
first
of
all
,
you
do
not
have
a
right
to
safety
,
if
your
friend
was
acting
in
a
negligent
manner
with
his
firearm
and
breaking
the
law
then
he
shall
be
prosecuted
.
to
demand
that
other
people
forfeit
their
rights
as
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
so
you
can
gain
a
false
illusion
of
safety
and
security
is
absurd
,
although
sadly
this
is
the
view
of
many
today
.
just
about
every
downfall
of
a
free
nation
to
a
totalitarian
one
begins
with
irrational
fear
,
then
the
removal
of
human
rights
in
the
name
of
public
safety
.
in
regard
to
your
"
problems
"
.
1
.
whether
or
not
you
object
to
being
in
an
unsafe
situation
is
irrelevant
,
you
are
responsible
for
your
own
safety
in
the
end
.
do
n't
like
it
?
too
bad
,
as
i
said
being
safe
is
not
a
right
,
it
's
your
responsibility
.
easy
solution
,
do
n't
hang
out
with
that
guy

like
this
do
not
supply
the
black
market
in
significant
numbers
,
as
most
gun
owners
are
not
this
irresponsible
,
although
a
lot
of
illegal
guns
are
stolen
and
straw
purchases
.
but
nonetheless
,
it
really
makes
no
difference
where
they
come
from
because
as
long
as
there
is
a
demand
,
there
will
be
a
supply
,
if
they
can
no
longer
steal
guns
,
they
will
illegally
import
them
,
if
they
can
no
longer
import
them
they
will
fabricate
them
themselves
.
do
n't
think
that
is
possible
,
then
you
are
very
ignorant
of
reality
because
they
can
fabricate
fully
automatic
assault
rifles
in
third
world
countries
with
primitive
tools
and
skills
,
and
i
have
even
seen
cases
of
people
making
a
.22
handgun
in
a
state
prison
.
this
argument
is
so
exhausted
there
's
no
other
word
for
it
than
stupid
.
and
it
's
not
just
guns
,
it
's
the
prohibition
of
anything
.
this
country
has
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
banning
any
type
of
item
does
not
work
,
and
in
fact
only
makes
the
problem
significantly
worse
.
it
has
not
worked
with
alcohol
,
the
war
on
drugs
is
an
even
more
impressive
failure
and
waste
of
money
,
it
has
not
worked
with
the
current
restrictions
on
firearms
,
and
will
not
work
with
any
further
ones
.
if
gun
restrictions
worked
in
this
country
,
chicago
and
dc
would
be
the
safest
places
in
america
,
in
which
they
are
not
,
and
vermont
and
new
hampshire
would
be
the
most
dangerous
.

"
a
well
regulated
militia
,
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
,
the
right
of
the

to
keep

arms
,
shall

"
i
find
is
odd
all
the
responses
,
so
far
in
the
debate
,
have
not
touched
on
the
main
reason
,
in
my
mind
,
why
i
would
never
let
the
law
makers
take
the
2nd
amendment
away
.
it
's
not
for
the
protection
of
home
invaders
,
it
's
not
for
hunting
and
it
's
not
even
for
attacks
on
the
street
,
it
's
for
protection
from
the
powers
to
be
.
i
believe
the
main
reason
we
should
all
support
the
2nd
amendment
is
to
keep
the
power
of
gun
ownership
in
our
hands
and
not
in
the
hands
of
the
government
.
if
all
american
citizens
loose
their
right
to
gun
ownership
the
only
ones
left
with
the
guns
are
the
police
....
and
this
is
a
scary
thought
.
<new_line>
strongly
agree
!
"
if
guns
were
against
the
law
only
criminals
would
own
one
.
"
<new_line>
hell
no
!
guns
should
definitely
not
be
banned
.
some
people
in
this
country
depend
on
guns
to
kill
animals
for
food
.
guns
do
n't
kill
people
.
people
kill
people
.
<new_line>
no
,
but
they
should
be
registered
,
and
concealed
weapons
and
handguns
should
not
be
carried
in
public
.
<new_line>
not
banned
,
but
it
would
be
reasonable
to
restrict
and
regulate
access
to
guns
like
in
europe
.
<new_line>
no
because
the
second
amendments
says
and
i
quote
"
a
well
regulated
militia
,
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
,
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
,
shall
not
be
infringed
.
"
<new_line>
absolutely
not
.
in
fact
,
if
we
force
everyone
to
carry
a
.40
s&w;than
crime
rates
will
drop
dramatically
.
my
question
is
,
as
a
criminal
,
will
you
attempt
to
kill
someone
if
everyone
else
in
sight
is
carrying
a
large
handgun
?
a
.40
s&w;is
a
large
handgun
,
and
will
drop
the
toughest
people
in
3
shots
.
something
else
you
must
keep
in
mind
is
that
if
we
outlaw
guns
,
the
only
people
with
guns
will
be
outlaws
,
this
leaves
no
defense
for
law
abiding
citizens
.
now
on
to
several
specific
types
of
guns
these
idiots
wish
to
outlaw
.
shotgun
:
a
shotgun
is
not
concealable
,
no
one
carrying
a
shotgun
is
going
to
get
very
far
before
being
detained
,
or
with
the
"
shall
carry
"
law
,
possibly
shot
.
a
shotgun
does
way
too
much
damage
for
you
to
carry
it
into
public
with
positive
intents
.
anyone
who
kills
a
shotgun
wielder
can
get
away
with
the
third
degree
.
next
semi
auto
:
semi
-
auto
is
used
by
people
wishing
to
reduce
recoil
,
people
hunting
with
poor
aim
,
or
someone
who
needs
self
defense
.
finally
the
ak
:
someone
said
you
do
n't
need
an
ak
to
take
out
a
deer
,
first
of
all
,
the
ak
is
a
semi
-
auto
weapon
if
it
is
legal
.
second
,
the
7.62x39
shell
is
considered
small
for
a
deer
,
yes
that
is
right
,
the
ak-47
is
a
small
gun
.
third
,
it
is
very
reliable
.
people
want
ak-47s
so
they
can
literally
bury
them
in
sand
when
things
are
peaceful
,
dig
them
out
,
and
shoot
them
when
things
get
bad
.
fourth
:
it
is
a
collectors
item
.
anyone
who
supports
the
banning
of
guns
does
n't
know
enough
about
them
to
make
an
informed
opinion
,
and
is
n't
willing
to
learn
more
,
and
would
rather
live
in
ignorance
than
try
to
correct
their
views
.
as
a
side
note
,
all
of
you
tote
your
numbers
.
whether
the
u.s.a
.
has
the
highest
gun
death
rate
of
all
countries
,
i
do
n't
know
,
many
of
these
numbers
are
incorrect
.
still
,
if
we
ban
guns
,
and
get
every
gun
off
the
streets
,
people
will
find
something
else
to
kill
each
other
with
,
i
could
kill
someone
with
a
rose
if
i
wanted
.
either
way
,
if
the
u.s.a
.
's
numbers
are
as
high
as
you
claim
it
is
because
you
can
not
kill
someone
with
a
gun
with
a
dagger
,
so
instead
of
going
with
the
dagger
,
more
people
go
with
the
gun
.
<new_line>
woah
!
what
did
you
say
?
been
bad
in

i
m
british

and
very
anti

,
and
i
find
this
down
right
insulting

just

"

wait

"
i
hear
you
say

"
what
about
the

!
"
so
lets
factor
in
the
populations
and
do
this
per

uk

0.00102579
gun
murders
per
1,000
people
us
=
0.0279271

1,000

wow
,
sombody
was
wrooong
,
but
wait
it
gets
better
the
results
were
ranked
!
uk
=
32nd
highest
gun

per

us
=
8th
highest
gun
murders
per
capita
!
and
guess
what
!
it
was
a
32
nation
report
!
meaning
the
uk
had
the
lowest
gun
crime
rates
of
them
all
!

another
thought
,
did
you
ever
think
to
realize
that
the
strong
violence
in
strict
gun
law
places
came
before
the
laws
did
?
the
laws
are
strick
because
the
violence
got
bad
,
and
the
laws
were
made
after
to
try
to
stop
it
.
<new_line>
well
a
gun
is
different
than
big
macs
and
knives
,
because
a
gun
was
solely
designed
to
kill
things
.
and
when
someone
says
guns
do
n't
kill
people
,
people
do
,
that
's
like
saying
pencils
do
n't
draw
,
people
do
.
you
draw
with
a
pencil
.
you
kill
with
a
gun
.
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
rid
of
guns
.
of
course
it
would
be
a
bad
thing
because
people
love
their
guns
for
hunting
,
killing
,
etc
.
if
your
"
great
purpose
"
of
guns
is
death
,
than
yes
,
they
do
serve
a
purpose
.
it
's
my
personal
belief
that
violence
and
hate
only
results
in
more
violence
and
hate
.
if
america
stopped
killing
people
,
no
one
would
hate
us
.
the
two
reasons
why
people
use
guns
in
america
:
1
.
get
things
like
money
,
power
,
respect
(
kill
people
,
hold
up
stores
,
stuff
like
that
)
2
.
protect
us
from
each
other
because
we
want
money
,
power
,
etc
.
if
we
all
had
equal
money
,
power
,
and
respect
,
there
would
n't
be
any
competition
,
therefore
no
hate
,
no
greed
,
etc
.
we
can
outlaw
guns
all
we
want
,
but
we
're
always
gon
na
find
ways
to
kill
people
.
you
got
ta
attack
the
root
of
the
emotion
that
makes
people
want
to
use
guns
to
make
people
realize
gun
's
wo
n't
get
any
real
work
done
.
<new_line>
really
?
!
that
's
interesting
.
riddle
me
this
:
how
would
one
stop
a
criminal
with
a
gun
who
is
committing
a
crime
?
 
you
're
joking
,
right
?
you
do
n't
think
peoples
lives
have
been
saved
because
they
carry
a
firearm
?
why
do
you
think
people
choose
to
carry
guns
in
the
first
place
?
because
they
want
to
shoot
someone
?
let
's
look
at
big
picture
,
for
a
moment
:
guns
protected
the
life
and
liberty
and
freedom
that
you
now
take
for
granted
in
this
country
.
<new_line>
a
ban
on
guns
would
be
about
as
effective
as
the
illegalization
of
drugs
.
regardless
of
the
law
,
a
determined
addict
will
always
get
his
fix
.
a
determined
criminal
will
always
find
a
gun
.
and
the
law
to
ban
guns
will
only
serve
to
disarm
the
law
-
abiding
,
leaving
more
people
at
the
mercy
of
a
criminal
element
.
the
only
true
solution
to
ending
gun
violence
is
to
end
all
violence
,
but
that
is
impossible
by
nature
.
a
killer
without
a
gun
will
use
a
blade
or
blunt
object
,
as
they
do
even
today
.
if
you
ban
guns
,
violence
and
death
will
continue
.
ban
the
guns
,
and
the
knives
,
and
the
ropes
,
and
the
rocks
,
and
the
fists
.
the
"
gun
"
is
just
a
tool
.
it
can
be
used
to
help
,
as
well
as
harm
.
it
is
the
character
of
the
man
who
holds
responsibility
for
the
gun
that
determines
how
it
is
used
.
ask
yourself
this
:
would
a
gun
in
your
hands
bring
only
death
and
destruction
?
if
you
were
educated
about
,
and
familiar
with
the
weapon
,
would
you
be
forced
to
shoot
simply
because
it
was
there
?
could
you
envision
a
scenario
in
which
the
gun
you
held
might
save
your
life
?
watch
"
america
's
most
wanted
"
on
saturday
nights
.
with
every
scenario
you
see
,
ask
yourself
if
the
victims
of
those
crimes
might
be
alive
today
if
they
carried
a
gun
.
a
simple
internet
search
for
instances
where
a
firearm
saved
lives
,
and
a
few
minutes
of
careful
reading
are
all
that
you
should
need
.
<new_line>
a
ban
on
guns
will
do
nothing
for
america
except
make
it
hard
for
farmers
.
most
of
you
have
probably
heard
about
australia
banning
guns
after
the
port
arthur
massacre
.
we
did
n't
ban
all
guns
,
just
most
of
them
,
because
our
farmers
need
them
and
our
police
need
them
.
we
also
made
it
near
on
impossible
to
get
a
license
to
carry
them
.
what
i
saw
was
friends
burying
their
guns
in
the
back
yard
,
wrapped
up
in
oiled
cloths
and
stowed
away
in
pvc
pipe
,
rather
than
hand
them
in
.
i
saw
farmers
,
now
unable
to
use
their
semi
-
automatics
,
who
started
to
complain
of
repetitive
-
strain
injuries
because
of
the
sheer
number
of
times
they
had
to
work
the
bolt
action
on
their
rifles
when
culling
cattle
(
we
were
smack
-
bang
in
the
middle
of
a
drought
...
it
was
kill
or
let
starve
)
.
sure
,
gun
-
related
violence
went
down
.
but
violence
in
general
did
n't
go
down
.
it
simply
switched
to
different
forms
of
violence
.
and
if
this
country
ever
gets
invaded
,
they
've
now
got
a
population
that
ca
n't
fight
back
.
<new_line>
even
if
guns
are
outlawed
,
they
would
be
smuggled
in
like
any
other
drug
.
so
outlawing
guns
wo
n't
make
much
of
difference
except
it
will
be
harder
to
get
guns
,
besides
guns
are
also
used
for
sports
so
why
ban
them
?
<new_line>
never
bring
a
knife
to
a
gun
fight
!
!
!
!
i
do
nt
want
to
be
the
person
with
a
bat
or
knife
when
a
robber
comes
through
my
house
with
a
shotgun
.
<new_line>
well
yes
guns
kill
people
but
not
just
people
animals
too
.
but
honestly
i
do
n't
think
they
should
be
banned
look
cars
,
and
more
stuff
kill
people
but
no
one
is
banning
that
.
i
do
think
some
guns
should
be
for
protection
also
knifes
,
spray
but
when
it
comes
down
to
it
where
is
it
?
your
gun
will
be
right
next
to
you
for
emergency
.
but
guns
should
be
used
for
gangs
or
kill
someone
because
something
went
wrong
and
you
hate
them
,
no
its
for
needs
not
bad
!
<new_line>
well
i
doubt
guns
shoot
by
themselves
,
nor
have
feelings
to
kill
.
all
depends
on
the
user
/
owner
and
how
they
use
it
.
<new_line>
i
think
if
u
have
to
ban
a
gun
for
,
excuse
my
language
,
retards
kiling
peouple.the
goverment
should
step
in

<new_line>
ever
since
the
dawn
of
time
mankind
has
killed
each
other
,
cain
killed
abel
,
he
did
n't
use
a
gun
.
guns
are
tools
,
tools
for
self
defense
and
hunting
.
just
like
cars
are
tools
for
driving
.
cars
do
n't
drive
,
people
drive
.
guns
do
n't
kill
,
people
kill
.
anyhow
,
cross
the
border
gun
selling
would
still
happen
.
if
you
make
a
law
to
stop
people
who
already
brake
the
law
,
does
that
really
help
?
no
,
it
helps
the
thugs
.
because
now
law
abiding
american
citizens
have
less
protection
.
good
job
hippies
,
you
are
making
more
likely
for
that

who
lives
on

,
or
that
wealthy
old
couple
to
get
robbed
.
<new_line>
first
,
ak-47s
have
to
be
semi
automatic
to
be
available
for
civilian
use
.
second
,
dogs
are
good
for
protection
,
but
mainly
intimidation
.
(
i
have
a
german
shepherd
and
a
great
pyrenees
so
i
'm
not
saying
dogs
are
n't
good
for
keeping
your
house
safe
)
.
a
bullet
in
a
dog
will
stop
any
breed
of
dog
you
have
,
even
if
it
is
a
100lb+
dog
.
also
,
guns
are
great
for
protection
.
if
you
have
a
shotgun
,
a
robber
that
just
hears
you
when
you
cock
it
will
think
"
#
@$%
!
"
and
if
it
comes
to
it
,
a
homeowner
will
normally
pull
the
trigger
in
self
defense
(
be
sure
to
get
him
good
in
the
first
shot
because
only
the
first
shot
counts
as
self
defense
,
all
the
other
shots
are
assault
=
d
)
.
pepper
spray
and
tasers
are
do
not
have
the
stopping
power
to
save
you
from
a
criminal
.
if
s
/
he
is
flailing
on
the
ground
he
can
still
pull
the
trigger
,
and
might
hit
you
.
lastly
,
what
has
america
come
to
when
you
have
to
move
your
home
because
of
crime
rates
?
if
you
want
to
save
money
,
buy
a
gun
and
any
other
form
of
defense
you
want
.

as
my
father
always
says
,
"

on
a
real
note

i

i
do
n't
care
what
no
one
thinks
.
but
the
gun
does
n't
kill
anyone
,
its
the
person
that
decides
to
pull
the
trigger
<new_line>
guns
are
an
awful
thing
.
this
world
would
be
so
much
better
without
them
.
<new_line>
guns
do
n't
people
.
people
kill
people
by
using
guns
as
a
weapon
<new_line>
no

the

started
the
killing
bum
.
first
of
all

they

normally

a
cause

,
not

<new_line>
yes
because
not
only
can
people
kill
others
they
can
kill
themselves
<new_line>
people
kill
each

!
!
they
could
be

the
pres
<new_line>
guns
do
n't
kill
people
,
people
kill
people
.
except
,
of
course
,
when
a
snake
squeezes
the
trigger
.
<new_line>
however
,
japan
has
an
extremely
peaceful
society
(
except
for
the
yakuza
)
,
and
they
have
a
ban
on
most
forms
of
weaponry

<new_line>
i
agree
exactly
what
i
would
say
some
people
can
be
idiots
with
guns
<new_line>
there
should
be
no
guns
at
all
!
!
!
!
!

!
!

<new_line>
lol
.
.
<new_line>
this
is
why
we
ban
guns
is
n't
it
?
<new_line>
in
my
opinion
,
everyone
in
this
country
that
is
over
the
age
of
18
should
be
allowed
to
carry
a
gun
.
now
before
you
get
offended
,
let
me
state
my
case
.
if
everyone
had
a
gun
then
i
feel
that
crime
would
go
down
because
criminal
would
be
less
inclined
to
commit
a
crime
against
someone
that
they
know
has
a
gun
just
like
theirs
.
now
some
may
argue
that
giving
guns
to
people
will
lead
to
people
getting
killed
because
of
arguments
or
intoxication
.
to
these
people
i
say
,
those
that
would
kill
eachother
off
are
really
doing
our
society
a
favor
because
if
they
are
willing
to
commit
murder
then
really
they
are
uncivilized
and
are
a
threat
to
the
law
abiding
citizens
of
this
nation
.
that
s
just
how
i
feel
and
i
'm
sorry
if
i
offended
anyone
that
has
had
a
relative
killed
due
to
gun
violence
.
i
am
sorry
for
your
loss
and
i
do
n't
want
to
tarnesh
the
image
of
your
loved
ones
but
if
they
had
also
had
a
gun
then
the
asshole
(
i
think
this
word
is
appropriate
)
that
killed
them
would
n't
have
been
able
to
end
their
lives
so
easily
.
again
i
am
sorry
if
anyone
feels
offended
by
this
.
<new_line>
all
that
means
is
there
is
two
less
idiots
in
the
world
.
wait
let
me
rephrase
that
,
one
less
idiot
and
one
less
person
that
has
the
tendencies
to
commit
murder
.
win
win
in
my
opinion
.
and
virginia
tech
was
not
an
"
incident
,
"
it
was
a
massacre
.
if
all
the
students
had
also
had
guns
then
there
is
no
way
that
asshole
could
have
killed
as
many
innocent
people
as
he
did
.
my
condolensces
to
the
families
of
the
victims
.
<new_line>
bad
people
use
guns
to
kill
good
people
!
so
yes
,
guns
should
be
banned
in
america
!
<new_line>
they
would
shoot
the
criminal
so
they
can
protect
themselves
,
their
money
,
their
family
,
or
a
friend
.
guns
are
illegally
imported
from
south
america
every
day
.
criminals
are
already
breaking
the
law
,
what
would
they
care
if
they
just
broke
one
more
law
?
by
the
way
,
guns
end
wars
.
<new_line>
your
speaking
like
a
communist
.
"
if
we
all
had
equal
money
,
power
,
and
respect
,
there
would
n't
be
any
competition
,
therefore
no
hate
,
no
greed
,
etc
.
"
if
guns
were
never
invented
people
would
use
bows
,
knives
and
swords
to
kill
people
.
 
weird
,
last
i
heard
,
people
hunt
animals
with
guns
.
 
you
can
also
draw
with
a
pen
,
and
kill
with
a
knife
.
guns
and
pencils
are
tools
,
they
have
similar
tools
that
can
do
the
same
purpose
,
too
.
it
's
the
people
who
pull
the
trigger
,
stab
the
blade
,
draw
on
the
paper
,
etc
.
<new_line>
what
about
hunting
?
anyway
,
guns
are
illegally
imported
everyday
.
if
there
was
a
gang
that
was
coming
into
my
house
,
trying
to
rob
me
,
i
would
want
my
gun
to
kill
them
.
 
that
's
not
true
.
if
it
is
,
then
show
me
a
link
.
in
a
australia
they
band
guns
,
and
guess
what
?
crime
went
up
drastically
.
bad
guys
are
always
going
to
have
weapons
,
it
's
just
a
fact
.
so
,
should
n't
me
or
you
have
the
right
to
protect
ourselves
?
<new_line>
his
argument
sounded
much
more
thought
out
then
yours
.
i
'm
just
sayin
'
<new_line>
and
virginia
tech
was
not
an
"
incident
,
"
it
was
a
massacre
.
if
all
the
students
had
also
had
guns
then
there
is
no
way
that
asshole
could
have
killed
as
many
innocent
people
as
he
did
.
my
condolensces
to
the
families
of
the
victims
.
if
all
the
students
also
had
guns
,
there
'd
be
massacres
on
a
regular
basis
.
guns
do
n't
kill
people
,
people
do
,
but
people
with
plastic
butter
knives
kill
far
fewer
people
than
people
with
guns
.
<new_line>
guns
should
be
banned
because
all
it
would
cause
is
more
crime
rates
in
america
and
yes
i
know
even
if
guns
get
banned
people
would
still
find
a
way
to
get
but
at
least
there
wo
n't
be
so
much
crime
going
as
it
would
be
if
it
gets
banned
<new_line>
guns
do
n't
kill
people
,
i
kill
people
.
lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
<new_line>
the
police
will
do
an
excellent
job
at
investigating
the
murder
of
you
or
your
loved
one
but
they
will
not
protect
you
from
it
happening
.
those
that
are
so
against
gun
ownership
and
concealed
carry
have
never
been
the
direct
victim
of
a
violent
crime
.
<new_line>
no
matter
how
many
gun
laws
are
in
effect
the
only
people
that
will
obey
them
are
good
law
abiding
citizens
.
i
am
a
police
officer
in
pa
and
we
find
guns
made
with
wood
and
pipe
a
criminal
can
make
a
gun
for
under
2.00
.
if
we
ban
guns
the
only
people
that
will
be
armed
are
the
criminals
.
it
is
a
fact
that
murder
and
violent
crime
is
at
a
45
year
low
and
gun
ownership
is
at
a
all
time
high
.
guns
for
good
guys
save
lives
<new_line>
personally
i
like
guns
?
?
you
can
do
many
things
with
them
?
spray
water
?
?
?
squirt
juice
in
your
mouth
?
?
?
many
things
!
<3
<new_line>
guns
do
nt
shoot
people
,
people
shoot
people
.
it
is
impossible
for
a
gun
to
have
feelings
of
atred
to
shoot
someone
they
do
nt
like
whereas
it
is
normal
for
people
to
feel
hatred
.
i
understand
that
yes
some
people
have
times
where
the
really
'
hate
'
someone
but
how
can
it
go
from
hating
someone
to
killing
them
with
a
gun
?
?
&
yess;guns
and
cars
sometimes
are
used
to
kill
people
but
it
is
more
known
that
a
gun
is
used
to
kill
someone
.
if
guns
were
banned
we
would
nt
have
any
of
these
arguments
i
just
think
that
if
the
law
did
nt
invent
guns
being
legal
then
no
one
would
really
care
?
?
bann

it
clearly

,
yes
there
is
sometimes

!
<new_line>
.i
really
do
nt
find
you
funny
,
there
are
many
people
out
there
who
have

<new_line>
i
own

guns
and
i
have
only
killed
3
people
?
?
?
?
?
there
s
no
excuse
to
kill
above
5
people
:o
only
a
monster
could
kill
more
than
5
people
:p
<new_line>
.only
a
monster
could
kill
even

you
sick
mother
fr
<new_line>
i
seen
you

i
got
away
with
that
now
you
are
brodcasting
it
on
the
internet
you
hoe
<new_line>
well
...
i
suppose
people
deserve
to
know
not
to
flaunt
their
private
parts
in
your
face
but
did
you
need
you
use
your
thong
to
choke
her
?
<new_line>
.it
was
all
i
had
you
know
iam
not
that
strong
.
all
i
can
say
to
you
is
that
i
may
have
used
a
thong
but
at
least
i
did
nt
use
a
gunnnnnn
!
!

!
<new_line>

enough

?
<new_line>
.if
guns
were
banned
things
such
like
amo&things;used
to
build

would
be
banned
to
so
how
could
they
build
their
own
?
?
?
?
?
explain
that
to
me
now
<new_line>
prohibit
guns
where
appropriate

do

happnen
cheif
xx
so
what
do
you
think
about
guns
x
i
think
that
they
are
great
&
i
love
shootin

in
all
directions
xx
<new_line>
read
the
news
of
the
weird
;
it
happens
all
the
time
.
<new_line>
whatever
the
constitution
says
must
be
right
,
eh
?
<new_line>
guns
do
n't
kill
people
on
their
own
.
people
kill
people
by
using
guns
.
and
besides
,
do
you
think
a
lot
of
gang
members
buy
their
guns
in
a
gun
shop
?
nope
...
most
gun
crime
comes
from
gangs
and
criminals
who
get
their
guns
illegally
.
the
legal
guns
are
owned
by
the
police
,
home
owners
(
for
protection
)
,
and
hunters
,
etc
.
<new_line>
cee

first
of
all
,
if
you
are
incapable
of
spelling
out
the
queen
's
english
,
then
do
n't
bother
typing
out
all
your
gibberish
.
what
i
wrote
was
the
complete
truth
;
there
have
been
many
cases
where
a
gun
was
left
unattended
,
a
snake
came
and
wrapped
itself
around
the
trigger
,
and
shot
somebody
.
similar
incidents
have
also
occurred
with
many
,
many
other
animals
-
not
the
least
of
which
is
the
dog
.
<new_line>
is
it
not
most
important
to
please
in
the
bedroom
?
<new_line>
unlike
you
,
i
've
both
a
life
and
a
brain
.
<new_line>
if
you
go
to
the
bathroom
and
miss
....
,
you
wo
n't
be
getting
any
in
the
bedroom
;)
<new_line>
and
of
course
,
it
is
not
always
done
in
the
bedroom
;
it
can
be
done
in
the
bathroom
,
living
room
-
hell
,
it
can
be
done
anywhere
there
's
enough
room
for
two
people
to
hump
.
<new_line>
the
truth
is
,
if
we
ban
guns
,
criminals
will
want
them
even
more
and
there
will
be
increased
crime
.
defend
gun
with
gun
,
not
with
law
.
<new_line>
guns
do
n't
kill
...
people
do
.
outlawing
guns
will
only
make
them
popular
and
worth
more
money
,
like
prohibition
.
people
will
get
rich
quick
buying
and
selling
under
the
table
.
it
's
like
abortion
.
i
'm
completely
against
it
.
i
think
it
should
be
considered
murder
,
but
i
'd
rather
people
murder
safely
so
that
the
baby
and
mother
do
n't
die
.

like

<new_line>
regardless
of
whether
or
not
you
think
guns
cause
more
harm
than
good
,
this
is
not
the
issue
.
we
have
a
constitutional
guarantee
,
a
right
to
bear
arms
.
we
can
not
simply
disregard
the
constitution
when
we
do
n't
like
what
it
says
.
the
right
to
bear
arms
,
is
a
check
on
the
government
.
it
was
set
in
place
to
ensure
that
if
the
government
oversteps
it
's
boundaries
that
the
collective
will
of
the
people
,
could
if
necessary
revolt
and
start
from
scratch
.
it
is
meant
as
a
last
resort
against
tyranny
.
<new_line>
yes
,
because
'
gang
-
bangers
'
got
their
guns
from
legal
sources
to
begin
with
?
banning
guns
will
stop
gun
violence
,
like
the
prohibition
stopped
people
from
drinking
.
all
this
would
do
is
create
a
greater
demand
for
an
illegal
gun
trade
.
and
again
,
i
must
reiterate
,
that
we
still
have
a
constitutional
guarantee
to
own
guns
.
<new_line>
i
think
this
whole
argument
is
ridiculous
!
read
the
second
ammendment
people
!
the
people
who
use
guns
to
kill
people
will
not
be
stopped
by
a
dumb
law
like
this
!
one
should
have
the
right
to
defend
themselves
with
a
gun
!
killingis
already
prohibited
by
law
,
there
is
already
a
law
relating
to
this
.
<new_line>
this
is
one
i
've
been
wanting
to
see
for
a
while
now
.
it
'd
be
absolutely
ridiculous
to
ban
guns
,
why
would
you
even
want
to
do
that
.
so
what
,
people
are
using
them
for
bad
reasons
.
that
comes
natural
with
being
human
,
we
have
to
expect
some
people
to
misuse
and
abuse
the
things
that
can
be
of
good
use
to
others
.
it
's
just
like
the
debate
on
whether
they
should
ban
rated
m
video
games
or
not
,
it
's
just
pitiful
.
if
we
're
going
to
ban
guns
,
we
might
as
well
bans
knives
,
fireworks
,
and
even
computers
.
anything
can
be
used
to
hurt
people
,
that
does
n't
mean
that
it
's
always
used
for
negative
reasons
.
if
they
are
going
to
ban
guns
,
then
they
might
as
well
just
ban
everything
else
that
's
negatively
used
...
ha
good
luck
with
that
<new_line>
statistics
actually
show
that
areas
where
owning
guns
is
allowed
has
a
lower
burglary
rate
than
areas
that
do
n't
allow
it
.
besides
,
banning
guns
is
n't
going
to
make
it
disappear
,
just
like
how
illegal
drugs
are
banned
,
though
millions
keep
on
consistently
use
them
.
<new_line>
if
we
disarmed
all
the
law
abiding
citizens
,
the
criminals
would
have
no
resistance
.
criminals
wo
n't
obey
the
law
and
get
rid
of
their
weapons
,
that
is
why
they
are
criminals
.
besides
,
i
see
something
huge
coming
.
call
me
a
conspiracy
theorist
but
i
feel
i
will
need
my
guns
to
protect
me
very
soon
.
<new_line>
if
people
do
n't
like
guns
,
then
do
n't
buy
them
.
i
hate
rap
music
,
i
do
n't
buy
any
.
i
do
n't
need
to
ban
it
,
i
just
choose
not
to
own
it
.
my
having
a
gun
does
n't
affect
any
of
my
neighbors
because
i
use
it
legally
.
it
is
the
criminals
you
need
to
worry
about
and
banning
guns
wo
n't
stop
them
from
having
them
.
<new_line>
but
most
burgerlery
's
happen
when
you
arn't
even
home
,
in
which
case
the
gun
is
mostly
likly
to
be
stolen
itself
.
now
a
criminal
has
a
gun
in
his
hands
<new_line>
both
guns
and
knives
kill
people
,
but
guns
are
way
more
effective
at
doing
so
,
that
's
why
we
send
soilders
over
seas
with
guns
and
not
knives
,
and
that
is
why
guns
should
be
banned
because
they
are
too
effective
as
weapons
<new_line>
all
guns
are
used
for
is
killing
,
they
are
weapons
.
that
is
why
we
should
outlaw
them
,
because
all
they
are
made
to
do
is
kill
.
sure
you
can
kill
with
other
things
,
but
most
homicide
weapons
are
guns
.
<new_line>
guns
are
made
to
kill
,
if
not
then
can
you
tell
me
how
they
can
be
used
without
shooting
at
somthing
?
<new_line>
actually
austrailia
has
one
of
the
lowest
gun
mortality
rates
in
the
whole
world
<new_line>
most
guns
used
in
murders
and
homicides
are
obtained
illegally
.
it
's
also
in
our
constitution
,
saying
that
wear
have
the
right
to
bear
and
keep
arms
.
having
open
carry
laws
would
actually
decrease
crime
.
if
you
see
somebody
with
a
gun
,
you
are
n't
going
to
be
stupid
enough
to
try
and
rob
them
are
you
?
it
's
also
a
way
to
defend
ourselves
,
many
crimes
are
preventable
if
the
victim
had
a
way
to
defend
themselves
.
there
are
also
ways
to
get
people
to
use
and
keep
guns
responsibly
.
gun
safety
classes
and
marksmanship
classes
.
<new_line>
better
than
playing
dead
...
after
all
dead
men
have
trouble
forming
coherent
sentences
<new_line>
that
depends
on
the
person
,
an
elderly
person
or
computer
nerd
,
or
any
other
stay

home
person
,
will
be
at

.
someone
with
a
very
active

might
not
.
secondly
,
most
robberies
(
42
%
)
take
place
on
the
streets
.
only
14
%
of

are

,
which

happen
between

its

guns
being
effective
is
a
good
thing
.
if
i
was
a
40
year
old
man
with
a
wife
and
kid
,
and
someone
barged
into
my
house
trying
to
rob
/
harm
us
,
i
would
shoot
him
.
also
,
guns
being
effective
is
great
for
hunting
,
i
've
seen
people
try
to
hunt
with
bows
,
it
's
insanely
hard
.
<new_line>
i
never

i

<new_line>
alright
were
talking
about
america
we
do
nt
like
socialism
in
america
.
and
for
the
record
people
use
guns
for
sport
and
for
hunting
.
<new_line>
if
today
we
were
to
ban
guns
all
the
law
abiding
citizens
would
give
up
their
firearms
and
protection
.
guess
what
?
the
criminals
would
n't
give
up
their
guns
and
they
would
have
a
field
day
breaking
into
stores
,
banks
,
and
homes
.
and
when
you
are
the
on
laying
on
the
floor
and
watching
your
possessions
being
stolen
and
your
family
raped
and
killed
without
anything
to
defend
yourself
then
its
on
you
.
if
you
live
in
some
fantasy
that
the
world
is
perfect
and
the
police
can
always
protect
on
a
moment
notice
you
can
pretend
whatever
you
want
.
us
on
the
other
hand
want
some
protection
.
<new_line>
yeah
and
we
all
know
how
fast
insurance
money
comes
in
right
?
<new_line>
hey
i
'm
all
for
gun
rights
but
not
on
campus
.
think
of
all
the
hormonal
students
waking
up
early
every
morning
(
god
knows
what
they
did
last
night
)
and
going
to
class
with
a
sidearm
in
their
jacket
.
what
happens
when
a
fist
fight
between
two
boys
turns
into
a
shootout
.
then
the
next
thing
you
know
someone
sees
their
friend
getting
shot
at
and
they
pull
a
gun
.
next
thing
you
know
there
s
about
ten
kids
with
guns
drawn
shooting
at
each
other
.
i
think
that
might
create
a
few
more
deaths
on
a
regulaur
basis
than
once
in
a
schools
lifetime
a
single
shooter
.
but
i
remeber
hearing
that
in
one
school
shooting
students
had
shotguns
in
their
car
that
they
got
to
and
they
brought
down
the
attacker
.
i
think
that
is
acceptable
but
not
unregestered
guns
in
students
back
pockets
.
<new_line>
hey
did
someone
say
revouloutinairy
war
,
did
someone
say
vietnam
?
<new_line>
nooooo
!
they
could
punch
each
other
....
oah
and
they
could
run
each
other
over
with
ford
f-150s
...
i
honestly
think
thoose
could
be
more
deady
than
a
pistol
in
some
cases
.

guns
do
not
kill
people
.
a
gun
does
n't
have
a
mind
of
its
own
.
a
gun
can
not
pull
it
's
trigger
by
itself
.
there
has
to
be
a
person
on
the
other
hand
to
pull
that
trigger
.
that
person
kills
people
not
the
gun
.
on
the
other
hand
every
thing
else
you
said
i
totally
agree
with
you
.
<new_line>
that
's
your
opinion
and
i
respect
that
,
but
,
there
still
is
a
chance
of
a
rapist
invading
your
home
.
if
you
fall
down
the
stairs
,
maybe
one
in
a
thousand
times
you
will
break
your
neck
.
i
know
that
is
a
small
chance
,
but
the
consequences
for
that
small
chance
are
drastic
.
also
,
just
shouting
"
i
have
a
gun
!
"
at
a
robber
,
will
scare
them
away
.
especially
if
they
ca
n't
see
you
,
you
speak
in
as
low
a
voice
as
possible
,
and
with
as
much
confidence
as
you
can
muster
.
then
,
cocking
your
weapon
wil
double
the
effect
.
in
1995

an
85

<new_line>
none
of
you
understand
,
stopping
the
selling
of
guns
wo
n't
stop
criminals
.
it
will
allow
them
to
get
away
with
more
.
you
people
fail
to
realize
if
someone
is
intent
on
committing
a
crime
they
will
most
likely
get
a
gun
,
stopping
the
selling
of
guns
will
just
restrict
civilians
from
protecting
themselves
.
if
someone
wants
a
gun
for
a
bad
purpose
...
they
most
likely
will
get
one
illegally
and
it
probably
wo
nt
be
as
hard
as
most
of
you
seem
to
think
.
gun
ban
=
no
civilians
can
protect
themselves
using
a
firearm
=
criminals
can
illegally
purchase
guns
,
like
tons
already
do
.
you
people
are
stupid
<new_line>
can
a
gun
kill
someone
?
yes
,
but
it
ca
n't
fire
without
someone
or
something
pulling
its
trigger
!
if
we
ban
guns
we
have
no
defense
against
the
criminals
who
get
their
guns
illegally
.
it
is
easier
for
them
to
rob
houses
and
stores
if
the
criminal
knows
the
other
person
has
no
good
defense
.
<new_line>
if
we
ban

we
are

guns
are

by
people
outside

if
the

told
us
to
turn
our

in
it
would
lead
to
more
violence
.
criminals
who
do
not
follow
the
laws
will
keep
their
guns
or
get
them
illegally
.
in
australia
,
the
government
banned
weapons
in
1996
,
after
a
publicized
shooting
.
immediately
after
the

,
armed

rose
by

,

the

had
similar
results
.
we
have
the

to
bear

and
to
protect
our
life
and
freedom
even
if
you
think
we
do
n't
.
<new_line>
if
we
look
closely
,

do
n't

people
kill

but
there
are
millions
of
ways
to
die
and
everyday
,
it
is
a
miracle
to
stay
alive
.
if
guns
are
taken
off
the
streets
,
then
something
is
going
to
replace
guns
.
instead
of
a
gun
,
a
criminal
might
threatened
me
with
a
bat

now
,
should
we
then
ban
bats
?
that
is
like
banning
the
yankees
and
the

lol
we
should
not
ban

but
we
should
limit

we
should
limit

to
the

who
can

the

;
the

that
know
how

you
can
take
the

out
of

but
you
can
not

out

i

if

does
not

they

still
comit

<new_line>
you
might
say
that
guns
kill
people
but
they
also
protect
people
.
guns
should
not
be

because
defenseless
people
need
some
way
to
defend

who
ever
tries

harm

in

the
ultimately

if

someone

can

<new_line>
to
argue
one

the

,
in

is

the
argument
is
death

because
of

rarely

it

one
sided

do

)
first
note
,
yes
,
guns
can
kill
people
,
but
ultimately
people
kill
people
.
basic
logic
.
this
is
an
argument
of
purpose
and
existence
.
just
because
something
exists
does
n't
mean
it
has
purpose
,
and
if
an
object
has
purpose
it
has
existence
.
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
firearm
?
many
.
yes
,
killing
is
one
of
them
,
but
there
are
so
many
others
(
for
example
,
the
enjoyment
of
shooting
large
pumpkins
...
and
yes
,
i
do
)
.
equally
so
,
i
could
argue
that
as
a
human
,
you
were
created
to
breed
and
kill
on
the
whole
in
order
to
survive
as
the
fittest
,
but
modern
theories
and
cognition
seem
to
provide
a
greater
degree
of
purpose
to
humanity
.
of
course
,
most
of
it
is
bs

equating
lower
crime
rates
due
to
the
ban
of
guns
is
absurd
.
japan
has
a
peaceful
society

after

war

,
and
as

of
their

,
many
impositions
were
put
on
them

as
such
,
the
country
turned
inward

began

make
no
mistake
,
guns
or
not
,
the
japanese
were
not
exactly
the

of

up
until
recent
times
.
the
idea
of
self
is
not

to
the
japanese
.
subsequently
,
this
level
of
stress
in
japan
has
given
them
the
highest
suicide
rate
in

the

from
what
i
also
read
,
gun

actually
went
up
as
well
(
yes

the

but
if

the

in

you
need
a
license

already
by

lowers

with
out
guns
would
be
a
better

with
less

,
by

guns
only
protect
from
other
guns
and
create
firefights
the
military
and

may
need
them
but
for
what
does
anyone
else
need
them
?
the
police
can
protect
you
with
no

you
are
n't

they
wo
nt
have

.
i
rest
my
case
<new_line>
look
at
murder
suicide
rates
other
places
.
it
is
a
no
brainer
...
<new_line>
in
england
,
people
have
realized
that
guns
just
create
more
violence
and
therefore
,
they
have
banned
them
.
and
it
did
them
good
.
the
us
's
murder
rate
is
15
times
higher
of
that
in
england
.
(
that
's
a
lot
!
!
!
)
most
murders
involve
guns
.
the
most
common
argument
against
banning
guns
is
that
people
should
be
able
to
defend
themselves
.
but
most
likely
they
would
be
defending
themselves
against
guns
.
but
if
you
got
rid
of
guns
,
you
would
n't
be
needing
to
really
defend
yourself
.
yes
people
can
get
get
killed
other
ways
too
,
but
guns
are
the
most
common
way
,
and
guns
only
are
really
used
for
violence
.
it
takes
a
lot
of
rage
,
strength
and
energy
to
stab
someone
,
but
it
only
takes
a
twitch
of
a
finger
to
shoot
someone
.
guns
should
be
banned
!
!
!
!
<new_line>
are
you
not
thinking
logically
?
guns
purpose
are
for
protection
.
why
should
we
ban
guns
because
they
are
bought
and
sold
by
people
who
should
take
more
effort
into
who
they
sell
these
guns
to
that
are
inflicted
and
abused
and
sadly
kill
other
people
.
why
take
away
a
right
to
every
american
to
keep
a
fire
arm
for
the
sole
purpose
of
protecting
his
/
her
loved
ones
,
belongings
or
property
,
because
of
the
mistakes
and
wrong
intentions
of
disgusting
,
self
-
less
and
corrupt
human
beings
.
it
is
just
like
the
bans
on
pit
bulls
.
you
put
down
an
animal
that
's
main
intention
inbedded
in
it
's
nature
is
to
be
mans
companion
.
yet
let
the
"
man
"
who
raised
the
dog
from
birth
get
a
hefty
fine
and
go
unscathed
?
ridiculous
,
banning
a
product
/
thing
,
only
create
doorways
for
illegal
markets
,
and
bring
ideas
into
the
heads
of
thousands
(
just
like
they
are
finding
ways
now
to
abuse
the
right
to
own
a
fire
arm
)
ways
to
still
own
and
sell
guns
.
it
is
n't
going
to
make
anything
better
,
it
's
just
going
to
make
matters
more
dramatic
.
<new_line>
do
you
really
think
that
if
the
government
were
to
try
and
take
over
,
that
your
22
in
your
gunsafe
is
going
to
hold
off
trained
soldiers
with
automatic
rifles
?
in
today
's
society
there
is
no
reason
for
guns
.
the
right
to
bear
arms
was
fine
when
everyone
had
the
same
revolver
or
single
-
round
chambered
rifle
,
but
things
have
changed
a
bit
since
then
.
<new_line>
firstly
,
i
am
a
trained
soldier
.
and
most
soldiers
never
move
their
weapon
's
selector
off
semi
.
secondly
,
many
civilians
own
rifles
;
my
brother
owns
an
ar-15
(
legally
)
.
many
hunters
practically
own
an
arsenal
.
there
are
many
civilian
based
"
militias
"
around
the
country
.
many
military
grade
weapons
are
actually
legal
to
own
.
certain
miniguns
are
legal
to
own
in
many
states
,
due
to
the
sheer
impracticality
of
committing
a
crime
with
them
(
due
to
their
size
)
.
not
to
mention
the
number
of
weapons
owned
illegally
.
thirdly
,
if
there
was
such
an
event
where
the
civilian
populace
felt
it
needed
to
overthrow
the
government
,
i
'm
fairly
confident
many
military
members
would
resign
or
defect
to
join
that
cause
.
finally
,
there
are
300
million
americans
and
enough
guns
to
arm
everyman
woman
and
child
3
times
over
,
if
the
civilian
population
was
determined
enough
,
no
military
force
on
earth
could
stop
them
.
determination
is
everything
in
war
.
remember
we
lost
the
vietnam
war
because
we
did
not
have
the
will
to
take
the
war
to
it
's
full
conclusion
,
and
we
won
the
revolutionary
war
against
a
superior
force
because
we
had
the
will
and
determination
to
fight
it
until
the
very
end
.
<new_line>
the
common
counter
-
argument
is
:
if
you
outlaw
guns
,
only
outlaws
will
have
guns
.
<new_line>
people
who
want
to
kill
,
will
kill
if
you
ban
guns
,
they
will
kill
with
knives
,
or
something
else
.
when
you
ban
guns
murders
will
still
happen
.
and
criminals
will
get
guns
some
other
way
if
they
have
to
.
banning
guns
will
leave
citizens
unprotected
from
the
criminals
who
get
guns
illegally
.
allowing
non
-
felon
,
non
-
drug
addicted
,
non
-
psychiatric
persons
to
carry
guns
for
personal
protection
should
be
perfectly
legal
.
<new_line>
i
d
er
have
to
disagree
with
you
on
that
.
what
if
they
steal
some
of
you
re

what
if
insurance

nt

that
.
oh
right
,
you
re
next
idea
is
probably
to
put
this
under

as
if
the
government
dosn't
control

of

at

,
if

into

(
how
would
they
have
gotten
those
guns
with
all
the
restrictions
may
you
ask
?
simple
,
they
would
have
stolen
them
illegally
)
,
i
would
defend
my
hard
earned

i
m
not
willing
to
risk
it
after
working
so
hard
to
earn
the

,
only
to
have
it
stolen
.
and
what
if
the
intruder
's
aim
is
to
kill
me
?
am
i
supposed
to
just
let
him
?
maybe
you

would
nt
mind
,
but
i
would
.
i
m
not
about
to
lay
down
my

for
some
random
creep
.
i
would
prefer
to
live
,
personal
preference
you
know

the
only
way
to
defend

is
to
bear

<new_line>
guns
should
be
banned
because
although
most
of
the
time
they
do
n't
do
anybody
real
harm
the
police
pose
a
threat
and
if
they
miss
they
could
hit
anyone
.
surely
,
even
if
somebody
has
robbed
a
sweet
shop
or
something
similar
to
that
they
should
not
be
shot
.
that
is
a
unnecessary
.
<new_line>
clearly
gun
crime
is
a
problem
in
some
places
.
and
when
we
look
at
gun
crime
we
find
it
is
prevalent
in
places
where
citizens
have
been
restricted
from
having
guns
and
the
crooks
have
all
the
(
illegal
)
guns
.
washington
dc
is
an
example
.
add
to
that
the
fact
that
gun
crime
(
in
an
area
)
is
not
related
to
the
guns
law
-
abiding
citizens
have
.
its
concentrated
in
high
crime
areas
where
gun
laws
are
weakly
enforced
–
at
best
.
what
we
really
need
is
more
guns
on
the
street
.....
legal
guns
<new_line>
although
bearing
arms
is
a
right
in
america
according
to
the
constitution
,
it
should
still
be
illegal
!
the
u.s
.
constitution
is
broken
beyond
repair
!
guns
are
becoming
more
easier
to
purchase
and
people
are
becoming
more
insane.humans
are
killing
more
innocent
people
everyday
!
the
only
proper
way
to
stop
this
epidemic
would
be
to
ban
guns
from
all
local
citizens
and
only
give
guns
to
military
or
law
enforcement
!
<new_line>
maybe
we
should
nt
be
looking
at
how
people
are
being
killed
but
who
is
doing
it
.
fact
is
go
in
any
prison
and
what
color
do
you
see
?
black
and
brown
.
so
if
your
going
to
get
a
handle
on
violence
then
get
rid
of
the
problem
causers
not
one
of
our
only
ways

<new_line>
lets
say
a
cop
pulls
someone
over
with
a
trunk
full
of
dope
and
they
have
an
illegally
bought
gun
.
then
what
?
ask
him
to
stop
?
no
police
need
guns
to
keep
the
piece
.
<new_line>
great
idea
!
go
run
for

.
so
what
do
we
do
with
att
the
guns
people
have
now
?
o
lets
go
to
their
house
and
get
them
.
ya
that

some
of
the

police
are
not
your

gaurd
,
it
is
your

lets

they

just

what

if
i
was
going
top
rob
a
house
in
an
area
guns
were
legal
or
not
i
would
have
a
gun.because
guese
what
if
i
m
breaking
the

anyway
might
as
well
be
a

at

.
<new_line>
that
s
a
niave
and
stupid
comment
,
while
driving
etc
is
dangerous
,
the
sole
purpose
of
a
gun
is
to
kill
people
.
cars
are
useful
and
when
used
correctly
are
nt
dangerous
,
could
be
wrong
but
i
m
pretty
sure
without
sex
we
'd
become
extinct
,
and
without
the
sun
we
d
die
guns
have
the
sole
purpose
to
kill
and
there
s
no
need
to
be
allowed
<new_line>
with
regards
to
"
guns
do
nt
kill
people
on
there
own
"
no
the
do
nt
however
their
sole
purpose
is
to
kill
and
without
a
gun
it
is
harder
to
kill
someone
(
granted
you
canuse
other
weapons
however
they
are
generaly
less
effetive
and
arentgoing
to
harm
as
man
people
)
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
most
gun
crime
is
from
illegl
guns
,
in
that
case
why
not
make
all
guns
illegal
.
i
maintain
that
making
guns
illegal
would
make
it
harder
for
people
to
get
hold
of
them
.
<new_line>
precisely
what
we
are
proposing
,
the
fact
that
all
guns
will
be
illegal
(
aside
from
certain
licenced
people
)
will
mean
that
guns
are
nt
allowed
and
no
one
has
gunsmeaning
that
the
only
people
with
the
guns
are
outlaws
and
can
be
dealt
with
through
law
<new_line>
no
because
it
is
our
right
to
be
able
to
defend
oneself
,
and
those
we
love
.
remeber
it
does
not
mean
attack
those
who
are
a
threat
,
it
means
only
using
them
to
defend
ourselves
,
as
civilians
.
i
personally
do
not
find
a
need
for
one
,
because
i
have
all
the
protection
i
need
.
jesus
christ
.
<new_line>
accoding
to
my
statstics
that
s
still
a
quater
of
the
american
homocide
rate
.
also
i
do
nt
tink
that
the
knife
crime
is
a
valid
arguement
seing
as
i
m
pretty
sure
you
get
more
than
11
rounds
in
a
gun
.
i
m
not
trying
to
argue
that
stopping
guns
will
prevent
crime
,
but
i
m
pretty
sure
that
if
the
person
in
china
had
had
a
gun
,
it
would
have
been
a
hell
of
a
lot
worse
<new_line>
no
absolutely
no
!
if
that
ever
occurs
,
the
united

has
fallen
,
it
will
be
goodbye
time
to
freedom
<new_line>
except
that
they
have
n't
,
ca
n't
,
and
wo
n't
be
dealt
with
by
the
law
.
the
same
reason
why
banning
alcohol
during
prohibition
did
n't
prevent
people
from
consuming
alcohol
,
and
the
same
reason
why
the
current
drug
war
does
n't
prevent
people
from
doing
drugs
.
prohibition
does
n't
work
!
even
if
we
wanted
to
ban
firearms
,
we
have
a
constitutional
guarantee
.
the
only
difference
this
would
do
is
to
disarm
law
abiding
citizens
and
to
strip
them
of
their
constitutional
rights
.
<new_line>
that
is
a
rediculous
arguement
,
that
s
like
saying
,
people
still
murder
we
may
as
well
make
it
legal
.
and
this
is
something
i
do
nt
understand
about
you
americans
,
why
do
you
want
guns
so
much
?
the
only
thing
they
are
there
for
is
to
kill
and
harm
others
,
the
fact
that
you
have
some
flimsy
piece
of
paper
saying
you
are
allowed
them
does
nt
make
it
right
that
you
should
.
i
do
nt
see
a
single
valid
reason
why
you
should
have
a
gun
and
yet
there
are
plenty
of
reasons
that
you
should
nt
have
them
.
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
you
did
not
present
one
valid
arguement
there
.
the
war
on
drugs
we
have
to
fight
just
like
we
fight
the
war
on
terrorism
,
it
may
not
be
sucessful
but
its
far
better
than
the
alternative
.
the
exact
same
is
applied
here
<new_line>
on
the
contrary
,
it
's
your
spelling
that
is
"
rediculous
"
.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
"
safe
"
murder
,
murder
inevitably
always
violates
someone
's
rights
.
there
is
such
a
thing
as
"
safe
"
gun
ownership
which
itself
violates
nobody
's
rights
,
your
comparison
is
nonsense
.
 
because
it
is
our
constitutional
right
.
because
they
allowed
us
to
earn
our
independence
?
because
we
have
a
long
and
storied
hunting
culture
.
 
well
you
're
ignoring
the
fact
that
guns
are
also
used
for
sport
shooting
,
and
hunting
.
not
to
mention
the
very
fact
that
someone
posses
a
firearm
is
often
enough
to
scare
off
a
would
-
be
criminal
.
if
this
is
n't
enough
guns
have
in
instances
been
used
to
defend
one
's
family
against
home
intruders
.
they
are
also
a
safeguard
against
tyranny
.
if
criminals
are
n't
following
the
current
gun
regulations
that
we
already
have
,
what
makes
you
think
they
are
going
to
follow
a
prohibition
on
firearms
?
remember
the
united
states
is
not
an
island
,
we
will
always
have
easy
access
to
firearms
whether
they
are
legal
or
illegal
.
 
this
'
flimsy
'
piece
of
paper
guarantees
our
rights
as
citizens
,
it
protects
us
from
our
own
government
and
it
protects
us
from
foreign
governments
.
it
has
been
the
inspiration
for
other
constitutions
around
the
world
.
it
extrapolates
the
views
that
unite
americans
as
a
people
,
and
has
been
instrumental
in
our
rise
to
dominance
as
a
world
power
.
it
is
the
bedrock
of
my
nation
and
it
ensures
my
liberty
.
it
may
not
mean
a
lot
to
you
,
but
i
defend
this
"
flimsy
"
piece
of
paper
with
my
very
life
,
not
the
paper
itself
but
the
ideas
and
principals
that
it
represents
.
if
you
do
n't
understand
this
,
you
will
never
have
an
understanding
that
transcends
your
little
cultural
bubble
.
 
i
just
listed
a
bunch
of
reasons
:
-we
have
a
constitutional
guarantee
-recreational
hunting
-sport
shooting
-deters
would
-
be
criminals
-safeguard
against
tyranny
-protect
home
to
say
you
did
n't
see
a
single
reason
is
to
say
your
eyes
were
closed
.
you
can
not
win
a
debate
with
denial
.
part
of
the
fear
of
firearms
is
with
negative
cultural
associations
,
particularly
with
gun
crime
,
but
firearms
along
with
just
about
anything
else
can
be
misused
,
this
is
not
in
itself
justification
to
ban
or
prohibit
ownership
of
such
possessions
.
knives
are
used
almost
as
often
if
not
more
so
in
crimes
than
are
guns
,
the
reason
nobody
is
pushing
to
ban
knives
is
because
knives
do
n't
have
the
same
negative
cultural
association
guns
have
.
please
give
me
the
reasons
you
think
we
should
n't
be
allowed
to
own
firearms
.
 
i
think
we
should
attempt
to
help
drug
addicts
,
but
punishing
people
for
an
addiction
is
pure
insanity
.
people
are
getting
locked
up
even
for
harmless
drugs
like
marijuana
and
yet
many
more
dangerous
drugs
,
more
addictive
drugs
,
are
completely
legal
such
as
prescription
drugs
.
the
drug
war
,
is
complete
bs
,
just
like
your
argument
.
<new_line>
but
you
missed
the
point
that
by
making
guns
illegal
,
criminals
are
still
going
to
smuggle
them
as
much
as
they
currently
do
.
and
their
only
purpose
is
not
just
for
killing
.
i
would
love
to
own
a
gun
just
for
show
!
like
a
vase
or
a
painting
.
i
'd
also
love
to
shoot
a
gun
just
for
fun
.
<new_line>
i
only
wish
all
people
out
there
wanted
it
just
for
show
,
then
i
would
have
no
issue
with
it
.
unfortunately
i
m
pretty
sure
that
a
majority
of
people
want
it
for
other
reasons
<new_line>
it
is
time
all
the
good
guys
and
cops
be
trained
to
handle
and
carry
guns
.
terrorist
are
waiting
to
come
into
our
children
schools
.
they
are
not
there
for
show
and
tell
.
they
are
there
to
kill
and
kill
.
this
why
we
need
cops
with
guns
and
other
good
guys
to
stop
the
threat
before
our
children
our
killed
.
they
are
out
there
just
waiting
for
their
orders
to
strike
!
did
we
forget
about
russia
beslan
school
in
2004
?
380
deaths
and
783
injured
!
these
cops
did
not
have
guns
and
had
to
wait
for
the
russian
military
to
come
(
and
wait
and
wait
,
while
innocent
children
was
murdered
!
)
.
just
think
what
one
armed
trained
cop
or
good
guy
could
have
done
!
do
n’t
think
for
a
second
it
could
n’t
happen
to
your
school
or
your
children
.
it
is
time
that
citizen
’s
stand
up
for
their
unarmed
cops
/
security
and
demand
they
are
armed
and
trained
.
<new_line>
if
the
government
tries
to
take
my
guns
they
'll
have
to
go
through
lots
of
bullets
first
plus
the
government
would
collapse
and
people
would
be
killing
the
government
for
trying
to
take
them
.
and
i
would
help
.........
oh
question
do
guns
sneak
out
at
night
and
go
kill
your
neighbors
and
kill
you
......
<new_line>
you
shout
the
criminal
!
!
!
!
!
!
!
!
!
!
!
!
!
!
!
!
!

that
s
why
we
have
them

!
!
!
!
!
!
!
!

<new_line>
yes
and
that
"
other
reason
"
is
protection
.
the
only
people
who
would
buy
a
gun
in
a
legal
manner
for
an
illegal
activity
are
the
kinds
of
people
with
nothing
to
live
for
or
no
common
sense
.
either
way
,
they
are
not
going
to
use
that
gun
very
long
.
<new_line>
i
believe
that
there
is
a
reason
the
police
are
trained
with
a
knowledge
of
martial
arts
and
there
is
also
a
reason
why
they
have
bullet
proof
vests
and
all
of
that
.
<new_line>
what
i
do
not
understand
is
why
the
winning
argument
for
this
is
'
no
,
guns
do
n't
kill
people
'
,
when
clearly
they
are
a
weapon
used
for
harming
or
killing
.
there
is
no
way
a
sane
person
can
honestly
say
guns
are
good
and
the
fact
they
exist
is
a
great
way
to
improve
our
planet
!
'
guns
are
bad
,
they
kill
.
however
i
realise
that
if
there
were
a
serious
offence
and
someone
attacked
the
police
with
a
gun
things
could
turn
bad
quickly
.
which
is
why
i
have
tagged
this
as
'
keep
the
guns
,
change
the
system
'
.
perhaps
they
should
change
the
law
and
copy
the
english
where
the
police
have
guns
in
serious
conditions
but
usually
they
leave
them
alone
.
any
arguments
?
any
arguments
?
<new_line>
guns
are
two
sided
.
they
can
protect
you
when
someone
breaks
into
your
house
,
but
they
can
hurt
if
someone
pulls
one
on
you
.
<new_line>
guns
do
nt
kill
people
cause
someone
has
to
pull
the
trigger
or
be
dropped
people
who
want
to
ban
guns
have
never
felt
the
nice
chill
of
fine
steel
in
there
hands
<new_line>
this
question
is
ridiculous
.
no

"
a
free
people
ought
not
only
to
be
armed
and
disciplined
,
but
they
should
have
sufficient
arms
and
ammunition
to
maintain
a
status
of
independence
from
any
who
might
attempt
to
abuse
them
,
which
would
include
their

the
liberties
of
our
country
,
the
freedom
of
our
civil
constitution
,
are
worth
defending
at
all
hazards
;
and
it
is
our
duty
to
defend
them
against
all
attacks
.
we
have
received
them
as
a
fair
inheritance
from
our
worthy
ancestors
:
they
purchased
them
for
us
with
toil
and
danger
and
expense
of
treasure
and
blood
,
and
transmitted
them
to
us
with
care

diligence
.
it
will
bring
an
everlasting
mark
of
infamy
on
the
present
generation
,
enlightened
as
it
is
,
if
we
should
suffer
them
to
be
wrested
from
us
by
violence
without
a

to
be
cheated
out
of
them

the
artifices

yes

your

that

where
the

<new_line>
no

we

<new_line>
there
are
most
certainly
not
more
gun
deaths
than
anything
.
in
fact
,
cars
kill
more
people
than
guns
do
.
look
up
a
fact
or
two
before
you

<new_line>
have
any
of
you
actually
seen
bowling
for
columbine

?
?
?
<new_line>
ok
let
me
say
something
and
do
n't
take
offense
for
voicing
my
opinion
.
the
very
idea
to
ban
a
constitutionally
gurranteed
right
is
unconstitutional
.
i
am
sure
that
you
live
in
a
large
city
such
as
new
york
or
chicago
and
work
in
a
cubicle
everyday
isulated
from
all
of
the
real
threats
the
outside
world
presents
.
i
can
assure
you
that
if
some
one
broke
into
your
house
tonight
and
shot
your
family
your
opinions
about
the
right
to
own
guns
would
change
.
you
would
go
out
and
buy
a
pistol
and
be
waitinag
for
the
chance
to
use
it
.
i
live
in
north
carolina
and
this
debate
is
close
to
my
heart
.
i
have
seen
first
hand
what
happens
when
whistle
blowers
like
you
get
involved
and
screw
things
up
for
our
country
.
our
country
was
based
on
the
fact
that
a
man
could
buy
a
gun
and
live
out
in
the
middle
of
no
where
and
provide
for
himself
.
firearms
do
not
kill
people
,
the
person
pulling
the
triggger
does
that
.
the
presence
of
a
gun
for
protection
or
even
for
recreation
should
never
be
challanged
and
if
you
have
a
problem
with
guns
in
theis
country
go
somewhere
else
.
thank
you
<new_line>
i
agree
with
urstupid
,
no
matter
what
.
.
stupid
people
will
still
buy
guns
illegally
.
they
will
find
a
way
,
and
i
m
not
giving
up
my
guns
for
nobody
.
i
bought
and
payed
for
them
the
legal
way
.
and
if
someone
came
in
my
home
and
tryed
to
rob
or
kill
me
i
will
have
a
gun
to
protect
myself
.
<new_line>
guns

first
of

let
's
set
a

guns
kill

guns
kill

if

for

the

will

your

,
people
will
buy

who
ever
said
that
guns
do
n't
stop
a

or
any
other
criminal
,
last
time
a
check
three
rounds

dead

and
for
those
who
said
90

,
killing
…
guns
do
n't
stop
there
is
one
reasion
.
it

is

first

a

a
gun
is
an
object
that
has
no
life
.
people
control
guns
now
guns
in
the
hands
of
the
public
have
actually
done
more
good
than
bad
.
libya-
people
were
able
to
gain
guns
and
over
throw
a
unjust
ruler
switzerland-
it
is
by
law
to
have
a
gun
by
the
time
your
21
and
be
trained
with
it
.
they
have
the
lowest
crime
rate
in
the
world
.
<new_line>
like
many
have
said
,
if
guns
are
outlawed
,
only
outlaws
will
have
guns
.
law
abiding
citizens
would
have
to
break
said
law
to
protect
their
property
and
family
because
the
millions
of
felons
out
there
who
have
already
purchased
guns
illegally
would
not
turn
theirs
in
.
even
if
they
never
had
bad
intentions
with
them
in
the
first
place
,
spilling
the
beans
that
they
even
owned
one
would
get
them
in
trouble
.
i
wo
n't
be
turning
mine
in
if
the
day
comes
.
i
hunt
,
which
most
city
folk
no
nothing
about
with
their
processed
foods
and/or
vegetarian
ways
.
most
of
you
on
the
other
end
of
this
debate
probably
never
touched
a
gun
,
much
less
shot
one
before
,
and
base
your
opinion
on
the
decision
that
you
simply
have
no
use
for
them
.
deer
have
to
be
taken
down
with
an
arrow
or
bullet
to
be
field
dressed
or
taken
to
a
processor
.
cows
are
different
;
they
're
stupid
and
will
just
walk
right
into
the
butcher
shop
.
in
a
perfect
world,(not
my
perfect
world
)
say
every
firearm
and
ammo
round
was
gone
,
everywhere
.
bad
people
could
still
kill
you
with
a
knife
or
heavy
blunt
object
,
and
inside
your
bedroom
where
you
should
feel
the
safest
,
you
could
easily
be
cornered
and
stabbed
or
bludgeoned
to
death
.
i
think
any
of
you
who
would
n't
use
a
gun
to
protect
yourselves
wo
n't
use
much
of
anything
else
to
either
.
if
you
had
lived
in
the
country
,
and
were
raised
up
by
a
father
that
took
you
hunting
,
you
would
n't
feel
the
way
you
do
.
i
live
in
an
area
where
people
get
murdered
about
as
often
as
a
lunar
eclipse
occurs
,
but
i
always
keep
a
pistol
close
by
.
it
's
better
to
have
it
and
not
need
it
,
than
to
need
it
and
not
have
it
!
children
brought
up
around
guns
have
considerably
more
respect
for
them
.
when
you
hear
of
kids
finding
a
gun
and
one
shoots
the
other
by
mistake
,
i
think
of
a
yankee
that
never
showed
it
to
them
,
or
taught
them
safe
handling
and
i
imagine
he
never
shot
it
himself
.
if
you
are
satisfied
with
the
thought
of
curling
up
in
a
ball
when
an
intruder
crashes
through
your
front
door
,
by
all
means
do
.
but
,
they
are
going
to
kill
you
if
they
want
to
.
if
somebody
breaks
through
my
door
,
i
'm
going
to
shoot
them
,
and
then
ask
them
why
they
did
n't
knock
.
you
can
have
my
guns
when
you
pry
them
from
my
cold
dead
fingers
.
people
are
just
generally
better
once
you
leave
the
city
.
sure
,
there
are
still
people
living
off
of
the
system
,
but
mostly
people
around
here
have
to
work
to
survive
.
it
seems
much
easier
for
a
criminal
living
in
the
city
to
kill
and
steal
there
,
and
walk
around
the
corner
to
make
a
buck
off
the
treasures
obtained
.
god
blessed
texas
!
we
have
more
guns
than
any
other
state
,
and
by
far
the
nicest
people
who
would
go
out
of
their
way
to
help
a
stranger
in
need
.
i
've
been
broken
down
out
of
state
more
than
once
on
a
busy
road
,
and
helped
change
tires
in
florida
and
ll
the
way
back
across
to
here
,
and
in
every
case
it
was
hours
before
someone
came
along
that
gave
a
shit
.
here
you
'll
have
3
pickups
pulled
in
behind
you
in
10
minutes
time
,
and
that
's
on
the
road
less
traveled
.
if
you
do
n't
respect
our
second
amendment
,
you
are
a
yankee
,
democrat
,
and
a
douche
.
and
you
probably
use
your
horn
more
than
10
times
a
day
.
and
you
're
probably
a
bit
of
a
dick
.
you
probably
do
n't
say
a
kind
word
to
strangers
either
.
<new_line>
if
guns
or
firearms
were
to
be
banned
think
of
the
unemployment
rate
that
would
increase
greatly
.
firearm
companies
would
go
out
of
business
because
there
would
be
no
customers
.
the
ammunition
manufactures
would
go
out
of
business
also
because
of
the
lack
of
users
.
the
economy
is
already
unstable
as
it
is
.
this
is
one
of
the
many
reasons
why
guns
should
not
be
banned
!
<new_line>
if
we
did
ban
them
it
could
turn
into
what
the
prohibition
was
:
a
time
where
alcohol
(
and
now
perhaps
guns
)
is
sold
on
the
black
market
and
sought
after
arguably
even
more
.
if
we
ban
guns
it
'll
give
more
power
to
organized
crime
and
also
take
away
an
economic
chunk
from
the
usa
(
from
selling
guns
,
hunting
etc
.
)
.
it
should
also
be
noted
that
by
banning
guns
it
could
cause
social
upset
and
people
protesting
their
right
to
wield
arms
,
thus
causing
civil
unrest
and
cracks
within
society
.
<new_line>
so
guns
take
and
save
lives
and
for
those
people
who
are
talking
bout
kids
getting
hurt
cuase
they
think
its
a
toy
the
parents
of
those
kids
should
put
the
guns
in
safe
's
or
somwhere
where
the
children
ca
nt
get
to
its
called
being
responsible
i
mean
sure
some
people
are
stupid
and
go
buy
a
gun
they
know
nothing
about
and
either
hurt
themselves
or
somone
their
with
.
now
the
second
reason
to
keep
guns
if
you
have
a
robber
that
comes
into
your
house
and
you
think
oh
just
let
them
have
it
and
you
hide
somwhere
and
they
know
your
there
they
will
find
u
and
either
kill
u
or
rape
u
now
see
if
u
had
a
gun
in
a
safe
under
or
by
ur
bed
and
a
robber
breaks
in
that
s
when
u
role
out
of
bed
open
the
safe
grab
ur
gun
hide
somwhere
and
when
he
tries
to
get
shoot
him
in
the
stomach
or
chest
who
cares
if
he
dies
or
not
he
was
the
one
who
took
his
chance
on
it
by
robbing
you
.
and
you
should
feel
the
need
to
get
protection
especially
if
you
have
children
what
if
a
rapist
/
serial
killer
breaks
in
do
u
wanna
see
ur
kid
get
raped
and
killed
that
could
have
been
prevented
had
you
had
a
gun
to
protect
yourself
and
ur
family
cus
u
better
know
that
if
i
have
a
wife
and
kids
or
its
just
me
i
will
grab
my
gun
and
shoot
the
idoit
that
tried
to
rob
me
.
or
lord
help
me
if
i
have
to
stick
up
for
somone
who
does
nt
beleive
in
guns
i
would
help
him
even
if
he
could
help
himself
just
because
some
people
are
stupid
does
nt
mean
they
have
to
ruin
it
for
the
rest
of
us
it
called
hunter
safty
for
a
reason
and
it
does
save
lives
and
oh
ya
i
m
16
and
i
have
the
brains
to
know
that
guns
save
lives
<new_line>
but
guns
make
it
easier
to
deliberately
kill
people
.
much
easier
than
with
a
knife
.
p.s
.
i
've
never
heard
of
anyone
being
bludgeoned
with
a
big
mac
.
<new_line>
'
'
.
.
<new_line>
i
ca
n't
believe
anyone
would
be
okay
with
the
second
ammendment
being
broken
!
i
may
be
very
young
and
not
understand
as
much
or
have
that
much
experience
but
if
we
take
away
our
guns
we
take
away
our
rights
.
what
if
we
were
invaded
?
and
all
of
our
guns
were
banned
?
how
the
heck
are
we
suppoesed
to
survive
if
we
ca
n't
protect
ourselves
?
how
the
heck
do
we
cope
if
the
government
takes
all
of
our
weapons
away
?
what
if
it
's
all
a
trap
for
the
government
just
to
take
us
down
easier
to
control
us
easier
?
yeah
it
may
sound
outragious
or
stupid
...
but
just
think
about
it
....
to
stay
on
safe
measures
lets
keep
guns
.
<new_line>
usa

then
what
?
china
is
building
a
big
army
,
why
do
you
think
that
is

dumby

watch
the

darfur
the

are
also

you
think
it
can
not
happen
here
with

in

taking

you
folks
which
support
gun
control
are
lead
by

to
the

just
like
hitler
lead
the

look
where
their

(
not

attitude
got

you

are

you
will
never
admit
any

most
have
another

,
we
may
not
know
the
exact
agenda
,
but
you
can
be
sure
it
is
not
an
agenda
to
create
a
free
society
here
in
our
great
usa
.
you
want
to
control
,
you
are
control
freaks
and
listen
to
progressives
agenda
to
control
,
you
can
not
be
changed
.
there
is
a
study
underway
which
may
prove
,
you

are
the
way
you
are

,
you
were
dropped
on
your
head
when
you
were
babies
,
or
your
mama
got
punched
while
you
were
in
the
womb
.
which
caused
brain
damage
.
which
is
where
the
negative
attitude
comes
from

gun
grabbers
throw
rocks
at
the
tanks
and
thugs
when
they
come
to
rape
your
woman
like
happened
in
our
own
country
just
after
the
huricane
.
gun
grabbers
deserve
what
they
get
in
the
end
,
i
trained
my
kids
with
the

defience
,
as
a
training
ground
,
somewhat
true

and
the
revolt
started
with
taking
a
gun
from
another
,
jews
lived
because
they
fought
back
...
with
a

dumby
.
you
do
nt
want
gun
crimes
,
arm
every
citizen
which
is
willing
and
mentally
capable
to
defend
themselves
and
others
.
911
would

or
thugs
,
which
you
will
get
guns
anyway
reguardless
of
your
petty
laws
.
jokers
this
is
a
stupid
debate
and
wo
n't
change
a
thing
with
gun
grabbers
,
they
like
the
pain
and
lies
they
put
out
.
<new_line>
read
the
constitution
,
or
founders
knew
you
long
before
you
were
born
.
they
protect
you
from
yourself
.
<new_line>
there
is
some
wackos
out
there
,
to
me
you
are
one
of
them
as
well
,
and
you
do
nt
need
a
gun
.
but
i
would
never
stand
in
the
way
of
every
perfect
mental
sane
person
owning
a
bazoka
,
machine
gun
or
any
other
type
weapon
.
i
am
a
cop
and
21
years
military
,
who
are
you
joker
>
take
my
rights
away
because
you
hang
around
the
mentals
.
<new_line>
man
where
are
you
coming
from
,
what
about
china
,
have
you
studied
the
size
of
their
military
force
,
it
is
not
to
defend
themselves
.
are
you
are
a
control
freak
,
i
can
read
into
your
writings
,
into
power
,
or
you
have
access
to
any
weapon
you
want
and
want
to
keep
that
control
from
everyone
else
.
i
wish
you
lived
in
a
location
struck
by
the
huricane
,
you
could
defended
all
those
folks
which
was
raped
and
killed
in
the
hospitals
,
in
our
own
country
.
you
can
bet
you
would
have
disarmed
them
as
well
.
you
ca
nt
stop
guns
,
or
crimes
,
or
even
drugs
.
i
am
also
a
cop
but
not
a
control
freak
.
you
should
be
defending
the
constitution
not
burning
it
down
.
<new_line>
if
every
household
which
meet
criteria
was
mandated
to
be
armed
with
high
level
weaponry
,
it
would
increase
the
security
of
the
usa
.
watch
sons
of
guns
,
they
have
it
right
but
that
is
rare
in
our
society
.
we
would
fight
back
any
threat
,
and
may
lose
but
at
least
we
would
fight
rather
than
hide
because
of
being
disarmed
.
<new_line>
in
the
old
days
kids
went
hunting
and
guns
were
a
part
of
life
,
we
had
no
issues
with
guns
in
the
house
.
now
with
the
gun
grabber
attitude
yes
there
is
a
problem
,
return
guns
and
teachings
about
guns
to
our
kids
to
be
responsible
.
my
3
kids
are
pro
gun
and
they
know
how
to
use
them
responsibly
.
fact
,
your
kids
may
need
some
work
.
<new_line>
guns
are
inanimate
objects
,
guns
do
n't
have
fingers
to
pull
their
own
triggers
and
are
n't
alive
so
how
do
guns
"
kill
"
people
?
i
am
a
gun
collector
,
and
i
have
yet
to
kill
anyone
with
any
of
my
guns
.
<new_line>
i
agree
with
everything
you
just
said
,
and
defiance
was
a
great
movie
!
<new_line>
if
guns
would
be
made
illegal
,
then
only
criminals
would
have
them
.
comforting
thought
,
that
one
.
<new_line>
that
just
proves
that
only
people
who
own
guns
go
against
making
it
illegal
.
the
idea
for
banning
guns
is
to
make
it
more
harder
to
get
it
,
which
is
true
.
it
will
be
more
harder
to
get
access
with
a
gun
,
and
therefore
less
people
are
shot
.
<new_line>
every
year
30,000
people
die
of
gun
shots
in
america
,
and
still
there
are
many
states
that
do
n’t
keep
guns
illegal
.
there
are
people
who
are
afraid
to
get
shot
when
they
travel
there
;
this
is
a
sad
fact
.
i
argue
that
guns
should
be
illegal
for
many
reasons
.
first
of
all
,
guns
give
a
better
chance
for
criminals
to
commit
crimes
;
knowing
that
with
knives
they
do
n’t
stand
a
chance
.
second
,
there
is
a
greater
percentage
,
by
data
,
that
people
are
more
harmed
with
guns
rather
than
protected
.
gunshot
incidents
in
school
make
it
all
the
more
clearer
that
kids
can
unintentionally
shoot
.
finally
,
if
guns
are
illegal
than
it
will
be
harder
to
get
buy
a
gun
and
therefore
less
people
will
be
murdered
.
<new_line>
accidents
caused
by
contingent
actions
people
suffering
from
mental
illness
and
minor
may
use
a
gun
in
wrong
ways
<new_line>
i
concede
that
guns
let
people
kill
others
.
ultimately
,
people
kill
people
.
<new_line>
i
say
that
guns
should
be
banned
because
they
are
killing
thousands
of
people
each
week
<new_line>
okay
i
wish
there
was
both
sides
because
to
be
honest
i
am
doing
a
project
on
this
and
i
really
wanna
do
both
sides
.
we
should
banned
guns
because
in
the
year
of
2012
and
of
course
2011
there
have
been
many
killings
,
deaths
,
and
shoot
outs
.
shoot
outs
at
school
!
come
on
and
i
m
pretty
sure
there
will
be
many
more
that
's
sad
and
crazy
.
anyways
,
there
's
been
kids
dying
from
guns
that
either
accidently
went
off
or
one
is
shooting
one
another
.
its
not
so
much
their
fault
for
having
the
gun
its
for
the
people
who
sells
children
guns
illegaly
and
i
doubt
they
wo
nt
stop
because
to
them
that
's
like
their
salary
,
the
money
that
pays
bills
.
not
to
long
ago
a
little
girl
in
3rd
grade
(
i
think
,
but
she
was
young
)
got
shoot
by
a
little
boy
because
he
had
a
gun
in
his
bag
and
it
accidently
went
off
when
he
set
his
bag
down
.
kids
my
age
dies
like
everyday
that
's
scary
.
and
there
's
people
that
will
shoot
someone
for
no
reason
.
this
is
the
part
that
is
confusing
but
makes
sence
why
i
agree
to
having
guns
but
also
should
n't
.
people
say
we
should
have
guns
because
i
can
keep
my
children
safe
.
i
can
protect
myself
from
people
that
is
robbing
me
.
like
for
real
that
's
good
reasons
but
you
can
also
kill
someone
just
trying
to
protect
yourself
.
(
i
hate
death
if
you
ca
nt
tell
)
so
when
the
police
ask
you
what
happen
you
'll
just
say
i
killed
someone
because
they
were
robbing
me
.
like
they
already
got
their
consequence
because
you
killed
them
,
so
what
about
your
consequence
you
just
killed
someone
!
that
's
murder
!
either
if
it
was
an
accident
,
trying
to
defend
your
self
does
nt
matter
i
think
you
should
at
least
get
consequences
(
they
prob
.
do
but
i
just
do
nt
know
)
.
like
if
someone
was
beating
you
up
and
you
fight
back
you
will
get
in
trouble
for
fighting
back
.
so
why
is
it
different
from
shooting
someone
and
killing
them
.
hope
you
liked
i
kind
of
went
off
track
(:
but
yeah

guns
should
be
banned
everyone
who
is
saying
no
is
an
idiot
<new_line>
the
argument
"
no
,
guns
do
n't
kill
people
"
is
ridiculous
.
everyone
has
seen
a
shooting
movie
where
someone
ends
up
dead
via
gun
.
the
reason
people
go
to
war
with
guns
is
because
they
kill
people
.
<new_line>
i
agree
with
the
fact
that
guns
weapons
does
n't
kill
people
they
are
just
a
tool
that
is
being
use
,
such
knives
,
or
even
are
hands
.
the
one
who
is
doing
the
killing
is
the
on
handling
the
weapon
the
tool
.
<new_line>
guns
should
be
banned
because
kids
can
get
killed
and
there
is
shootings
in
the
sua
almost
every
week
get
a
life
and
stop
guns
<new_line>
please
stop
guns
in
the
usa
help
others
and
help
the
poor
<new_line>
the
british
are
n't
going
to
invade
,
so
we
do
n't
need
to
protect
ourselves
"
.
so
when
an
american
enters
you
're
home
with
intent
to
kill
,
are
you
going
to
defend
yourself
with
a
fork
?
i
do
agree
that
most
burglary
's
that
occur
do
not
involve
a
murder
or
serious
injury
,
but
not
all
home
invasion
's
are
with
the
intent
to
remove
your
property
.
if
i
we
're
in
the
position
to
put
my
life
on
the
line
,
or
lose
a
television
,
i
would
rather
lose
the
television
.
the
question
is
whether
this
person
is
here
to
steal
my
property
or
harm
me
or
my
family
.
i
would
rather
have
the
means
to
protect
myself
and
my
family
.
if
we
lived
in
a
perfect
world
where
we
did
n't
have
poverty
,
drugs
and
poor
education
,
then
maybe
i
could
see
you
re
point
.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
we
do
n't
.
when
america
gets
to
the
point
where
i
can
go
to
sleep
at
night
,
or
even
go
about
my
daily
business
and
not
worry
,
then
i
'll
consider
getting
rid
of
my
gun
.
until
then
,
we
live
in
a
dangerous
world
where
people
live
outside
the
law
and
i
feel
safe
knowing
there
s
an
amendment
granting
me
the
right
to
defend
myself
.
<new_line>
switzerland
has
a
gun
death
rate
of
6
in
100,00
.
america
has
a
gun
death
rate
of
just
over
10
in
100,000
.
england
outlawed
all
handguns
and
has
a
0.6
per
100,000
gun
death
rate
.
[

]
the
facts
are
pretty
clear
that
in
countries
where
guns
are
allowed
,
more
people
are
shot
and
killed
.
in
1999
,
there
were
28,874
gun
-
related
deaths
in
the
united
states
-
over
80
deaths
every
day
.
in
1999
,
58
%
of
all
gun
deaths
were
suicides
,
and
38
%
were
homicides
.
of
all
suicides
,
57
%
occurred
by
firearm
.
in
2000
,
75,685
people
(
27/100,000
)
suffered
non
-
fatal
firearm
gunshot
injuries
.
what
,
exactly
,
is
the
point
of
guns
?
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
america
has
a
culture
where
guns
are
ok
,
and
the
only
thing
that
is
ever
going
to
do
is
mean
a
great
increase
in
gun
crime
.
guns
are
pointless
in
this
day
and
age
.
<new_line>
guns
do
not
kill
people
,
people
do
.
what
would
be
next
?
banning
knives
?
banning
cleaning
products
?
banning
water
?
<new_line>
first
off
guns
do
n’t
kill
people
,
people
kill
people
.
guns
are
merely
tools
to
do
the
job
.
problems
will
just
get
worse
like
they
did
when
alcohol
got
banned
.
people
would
sell
alcohol
illegally
.
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
same
would
happen
with
guns
.
the
banning
of
alcohol
brought
us
al
capone
,
imagine
what
the
banning
of
guns
would
give
us
.
robberies
are
illegal
so
if
guns
were
illegal
nothing
would
change
.
there
are
three
main
reasons
why
someone
would
break
the
law
.
one
,
to
get
money
.
two
they
did
not
know
about
it
.
or
three
,
to
get
infamy
or
fame
.
<new_line>
maryland
has
no
guns
on
the
streets
or
anywhere
except
your
house
or
a
firing
range
.
they
also
have
the
highest
crime
rate
of
all
the
united
states
of
america
.
<new_line>
the
maker
of
the
website
obviously
was
for
banning
guns
due
to
their
being
no
no
button
but
in
-
staid
a
no
,
guns
do
n't
kill
people
button
.
<new_line>
in
maryland
it
is
illegal
to
carry
a
firearm
anywhere
but
a
firing
range
and
your
own
home
.
pwnd
<new_line>
really
...
stopping
guns
is
not
that
easy
.
with
alcohol
,
when
it
was
banned
people
could
sell
it
at
unreasonable
prices
.
that
is
how
al
capone
got
rich
.
so
people
would
still
use
guns
"
under
the
table
"
.
who
do
you
think
would
be
the
new
al
capone
.
criminals
rob
banks
,
robbing
banks
is
illegal
,
so
if
you
add
them
up
you
get
that
criminals
would
not
stop
using
guns
because
it
is
the
law
.

i
love
how
individuals
that
do
n't
know
a
thing
about
guns
are
trying
to
impose
their
views
to
infringe
on
others
2a
"
rights
"
.
no
one
is
questioning
the
1a
"
right
"
?
!
!
?
to
let
everyone
know
there
is
no
state
in
the
country
were
gun
ownership
is
illegal
....
that
would
be
unconstitutional
!
however
there
are
many
states
in
the
country
that
infringe
on
the
right
of
certain
types
of
gun
ownership
.
lets
take
new
jersey
,
it
is
illegal
to
use
hollow
point
bullets(which
are
legal
just
about
everywhere
else
)
because
so
one
got
a
hold
of
bad
information
.
a
hollow
point
has
less
chance
of
doing
secondary
damage
than
a
fmj
round
.
i
am
using
this
as
an
example
people
who
know
nothing
about
firearms
so
not
speak
until
they
get
the
facts
.
i
have
never
seen
a
gun
jump
of
the
self
load
itself
and
walk
down
the
street
and
start
shooting
people
.
if
some
one
has
i
would
like
to
know
?
?
?
the
actions
of
a
few
should
not
dictate
the
actions
for
everyone
.
people
complain
about
laws
not
working
because
the
lawless
are
breaking
them
.
i
value
human
life
and
the
police
are
not
required
to
protect
the
individual
.
(
i
ca
nt
remember
the
federal
case
but
the
scotus
said
that
the
police
do
not
have
the
obligation
of
protecting
the
citizen
)
so
who
does
?
most
people
do
n't
realize
that
semi
-
auto
assault
rifles
are
regulated
by
the
state
.
however
fully
automatic
assault
rifles
are
regulated
by
the
federal
government
.
every
time
the
new
puts
something
about
assault
rifle
they
show
full
auto
federally
regulated
rifle
which
can
only
be
transfered
and
not
but
new
.
(
the
federal
firearms
act
of
1985
)
.
so
get
the
facts
before
you
start
disputing
because
you
will
find
that
the
info
you
have
is
wrongfully
skewed
!
an
armed
society
is
a
safer
society
.

i
would
like
to
make
my
first
statement
by
saying
if
people
got
rid
of
guns
people
will
find
other
weapons
to
kill
people
with
.
its
going
to
be
a
never
ending
thing
no
matter
what
you
get
rid
of
.
second
is
everybody
forgetting
about
the
hunters
in
the
world
.
hunting
is
one
of
americas
favorite
sport
.
people
would
be
absolutely
devastated
if
that
was
taken
away
from
them
.
think
about
it
<new_line>
people
use
guns
to
kill
people
,
guns
do
nt
kill
people
!
i
had
to
add
more
sorry
.
more
<new_line>
well
being
in
an
area
where
gun
ownership
is
illegal
is
not
going
to
have
any
thing
to
do
with
the
criminal
having
a
gun
.
they
will
have
a
gun
anyway
.
breaking
and
entering
is
illegal
so
do
you
think
that
are
going
to
worry
about
carrying
a
gun
also
.
the
insurance
part
i
totally
understand
cause
i
have
a
lot
of
stuff
in
my
house
and
have
it
all
insured
and
i
can
replace
them
.
i
have
12
ga
shotgun
loaded
with
00
buck
for
home
protection
.
now
when
i
'm
not
here
the
insurance
takes
over
,
the
gun
is
only
to
protect
my
family
.
you
'd
rather
hand
over
your
stuff
and
write
it
off
etc
..
what
about
when
they
want
you
wife
and
daughter
to
do
what
they
want
.
not
a
cold
day
is
$
&
ell;that
's
going
to
happen
to
me
.
think
about
it
.
you
do
n't
have
to
kill
someone
just
cause
you
have
a
gun
.
you
have
the
option
to
if
needed
.
<new_line>
i
could
not
agree
with
you
more
.
especially
the
police
being
a
city
government
.
there
is
no
way
they
could
be
everywhere
at
once
.
a
gun
is
the
best
policy
.
<new_line>
guns
do
n't
kill
people
.
we
kill
people
.
ban
guns
the
the
murders
will
go
to
knives
or
their
hands
.
will
you
cut
off
our
hands
because
those
three
people
choked
someone
to
death
?
<new_line>
i
do
n't
mean
to
be
a
ass
,
but
that
is
one
of
the
dumbest
answers
ever
.
first
off
it
would
not
matter
if
guns
were
illegal
in
your
state
or
not
,
if
a
criminal
wants
to
get
a
gun
they
will
get
one
somehow
.
second
off
if
they
knew
you
were
armed
i
seriously
think
they
would
reconsider
entering
your
home
.
and
the
third
thing
is
that
if
they
know
you
are
home
chances
are
they
are
there
to
do
more
harm
than
just
steal
your
crap
.
learn
how
to
use
a
gun
,
be
responsible
,
protect
yourself
and
your
family
.
in
the
neighbor
counties
around
me
there
have
been
three
different
murders
,
and
they
think
it
is
the
same
people
,
they
are
targeting
people
that
are
home
tying
them
up
and
killing
them
.
would
you
not
feel
at
least
a
little
better
knowing
you
could
possibly
defend
yourself
?
<new_line>
yes
!
beacase
in
country
there
guns
are
ileagle
the
criminality
is
way
lower
than
america
stastistic
shows
that
<new_line>
guns
do
n't
kill
people
;
nu
uh
;
i
kill
people
"
chk
chk
"
with
guns
,
pow
<new_line>
guns
do
n't
kill
people
just
lying
around
collecting
dust
and
rust
it
depends
if
they
are
being
used
or
not
.
<new_line>
if
guns
are
banned
people
will
use
knives
and
other
weapons
to
kill
people
.
have
you
ever
heard
of
illegal
arms
dealers
who
sells
weapons
and
going
against
the
government
.
<new_line>
no
offense
but
i
've
been
threw
this
and
u
have
no
idea
what
ur
talking
about
i
would
rather
get
in
a
shoot
out
than
have
my
wife
or
kid
raped
and
killed
u
have
no
idea
about
what
happens
in
a
situation
like
this
u
think
that
they
just
want
money
<new_line>
man
were
are
u
from
i
use
a
gun
just
to
go
buy
my
grocerys
have
u
ever
even
been
in
a
life
or
death
situation
if
it
happens
then
come
tell
me
u
do
n't
want
a
gun
if
ur
alive
<new_line>
hell
no
!
second
amendment
people
:
right
to
bare
arms
!
it
is
our
right
as
citizens
to
be
able
to
protect
ourselves
when
comes
the
circumstance
!
<new_line>
second
amendment
a
well
regulated
militia
,
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
,
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
,
shall
not
be
infringed
.
deterring
tyrannical
government
;
repelling
invasion
;
suppressing
insurrection
;
facilitating
a
natural
right
of
self
-
defense
;
participating
in
law
enforcement
;
enabling
the
people
to
organize
a
militia
system
.
really
should
not
be
debating
this
,
non
negotiable
shall
not
be
infringed
.
<new_line>
guns
in
the
united
states
are
necessarily
to
protect
against
tyranny
in
government
.
this
is
one
of
the
main
reasons
the
2nd
amendment
exists
.
that
is
the
only
argument
you
will
ever
need
to
hear
against
gun
control
period
.
<new_line>
1
.
a
gun
is
an
inanimate
object
and
once
a
bullet
is
removed
,
it
is
as
useless
as
a
paper
weight
and
will
never
function
again
till
someone
makes
it
.
2
.
getting
rid
of
guns
prevents
death
,
but
hammers
,
screw
drivers
and
cars
killed
people
,
as
did
clubs
and
bows
and
spears
before
guns
were
ever
invented
.
3
.
obviously
being
unarmed
and
defenseless
or
running
from
a
criminal
is
better
than
using
a
gun
to
stop
them
,
especially
for
the
old
,
the
crippled
,
pregnant
women
,
etc
.
4
.
all
we
need
are
safe
rooms
,
martial
arts
training
and
a
phone
to
call
the
police
,
which
means
the
losers
who
live
in
mobile
homes
do
nt
need
protection
,
we
could
beat
carreer
criminals
with
our
bare
hands
,
and
a
police
car
miles
away
is
better
than
a
gun
which
is
inches
away
when
your
life
is
in
danger
.
5
.
people
who
support
getting
rid
of
guns
and
say
they
do
nt
feel
threatened
is
because
they
have
never
been
threatened
.
6
.
i
am
in
a
public
building
and
i
have
a
gun
in
my
vehicle
.
the
four
girls
around
me
are
alive
not
because
my
gun
is
out
there
and
it
would
scare
them
for
me
to
bring
it
in
in
my
hand
but
because
i
also
have
not
decided
to
take
the
framing
hammer
in
my
back
seat
that
they
would
ignore
and
use
it
to
beat
one
or
more
of
them
to
death
with
it
.
<new_line>
it
is
morally
better
to
yell
and
scream
at
an
armed
attacker
than
to
shoot
them
.
guns
in
the
hands
of
stupid
people
are
dangerous
.....
we
should
also
ban
stupid
people
.
everyone
knows
that
a
pregnant
woman
,
an
old
person
,
or
a
person
in
a
mobile
home
could
excape
trouble
by
hiding
in
their
bedroom
with
a
criminal
in
their
home
and
calling
the
police
who
are
miles
away
.
private
citizens
,
who
are
alone
in
their
homes
,
do
nt
need
guns
,
they
need
to
rely
on
the
police
,
who
travel
in
groups
,
have
radios
,
and
carry
guns
.
the
second
amendment
says
militias
have
the
right
to
carry
guns
,
not
private
citizens
,
and
that
is
why
the
militias
are
there
to
protects
us
and
are
composed
of
....
private
citizens
.
guns
are
extremely
dangerous
,
and
that
s
why
schools
which
are
gun
free
zones
as
are
churches
are
not
targeted
by
violent
criminals
while
guns
shows
and
reenactments
are
replete
with
criminal
violence
.
who
needs
a
gun
when
you
can
dive
under
your
bed
and
be
safe
from
a
criminal
?
a
criminal
might
take
you
gun
and
use
it
on
you
....
especially
if
it
is
better
than
the
one
he
is
carrying
and
since
he
can
get
to
you
before
you
pull
the
trigger
.
columbine
was
safe
because
it
was
a
gun
free
zone
and
the
guys
who
did
the
shooting
were
simply
law
abiding
citizens
who
happened
to
have
nasty
guns
.
besides
,
all
was
well
once
they
called
the
cops
.
having
a
gun
in
the
home
of
a
private
citizen
who
takes
it
out
now
and
then
for
target
shooting
is
more
dangerous
than
a
car
in
the
hands
of
a
citizen
who
drinks
himself
silly
every
weekend
.
<new_line>
i
have
a
framing
hammer
in
my
car
.
this
girl
next
to
me
is
alive
not
because
i
have
no
gun
and
can
not
bring
it
in
,
and
amidst
screaming
people
,
shoot
her
,
but
because
i
have
a
framing
hammer
in
my
car
they
would
not
notice
...
and
i
have
no
desire
to
harm
her
which
i
could
do
within
seconds
.
it
would
take
me
less
than
a
minute
to
kill
her
with
my
hammer
.
a
split
second
to
shoot
her
.
neither
of
my
implements
pose
her
a
threat
because
i
am
not
a
murderer
.
if
i
desired
to
kill
her
,
not
one
of
these
people
or
ten
thousand
cops
could
stop
me
within
the
next
two
minutes
.
<new_line>
the
beliefm
that
automatic
weapons
should
be
banned
holds
no
more
water
than
any
other
arguement
.
a
gun
is
a
gun
.
the
mmount
of
fire
it
produces
makes
no
difference
,
and
in
the
hands
of
an
ordinary
law
abiding
citizen
a
tank
,
granade
launcher
or
nuclear
missile
does
not
pose
a
threat
to
anyone
becuase
he
has
no
intention
of
using
it
.
in
the
hands
of
a
criminal
,
an
ink
pen
can
be
rammed
into
an
eye
and
used
to
kill
someone
.
<new_line>
no
cases
where
an
innocent
peson
has
defended
themselves
with
a
guin
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
either
you
are
under
twelve
years
old
or
you
have
done
zero
research
.
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
cases
of
innocent
people
protecting
themselves
with
guns
.
woman
agains
gun
control
,
the
second
amendment
police
department
are
only
two
places
that
will
tell
you
how
many
times
innocent
people
not
only
have
protected
themselves
but
even
assisted
the
police
.
<new_line>
that
is
utterly
false
.
guns
in
people
's
homes
have
prevented
them
from
being
victims
of
violent
attacks
in
countless
thousands
of
cases
,
and
your
militia
you
refer
to
was
composed
of
regular
urban
men
,
not
military
men
and
they
were
armed
.
seriously
,
you
want
everyone
to
believe
that
the
right
to
keep
a
gun
by
your
bed
does
not
help
keep
a
person
able
to
grab
it
in
the
face
of
a
violent
attack
and
fight
back
?
do
you
really
believe
that
the
"
police
"
would
ever
be
able
to
respond
quick
enough
if
they
could
even
be
called
?
or
do
the
lives
of
people
who
do
nt
have
homes
with
alarms
and
steel
doors
matter
?
tell
you
what
,
the
day
you
are
faced
with
a
violent
attack
and
get
to
experience
this
first
hand
,
we
'll
see
what
you
have
to
say
then
!
<new_line>
first
of
all
if
you
do
nt
think
we
ae
run
by
tyrants
,
you
do
nt
watch
the
news
.
second
off
,
when
was
the
last
time
we
had
a
leader
who
inflicted
terrible
damage
on
the
country
,
as
obama
has
,
and
gotten
them
impeached
?
your
arguement
is
entirely
false
,
and
on
top
of
it
,
i
am
not
worried
about
using
guns
to
stop
some
government
filled
with
corrupt
leaders
.
i
enjoy
target
shooting
,
i
enjoy
owning
antique
guns
,
and
i
fel
a
hell
of
a
lot
safer
knowing
that
if
i
am
attacked
,
i
will
not
be
empty
handed
and
helpless
.
end
of
story
.
<new_line>
if
someone
believes
that
students
with
guns
would
lead
to
regular
massacres
,
then
they
obviously
have
one
terrible
school
system
or
are
afraid
of
some
rotten
kids
.
aside
from
that
lame
arguement
,
no
one
is
suggesting
arming
students
,
we
have
long
suggested
that
instructors
and
officials
in
schools
who
want
to
be
armed
should
be
,
unless
of
course
you
are
going
to
argue
that
principals
will
go
on
shooting
rampages
.
ever
hear
of
that
?
<new_line>
you
are
right
on
the
money
.
first
we
banned
drugs
,
and
that
lead
to
a
drug
free
country
.
then
we
forbade
drunk
driving
and
that
put
an
end
to
drunk
driving
accidents
.
if
we
just
had
the
sense
to
ban
murder
and
rape
,
robbery
,
carjacking
,
along
with
guns
........
hey
wait
a
minute
....
<new_line>
first
of
all
,
crime
happens
on
a
daily
basis
,
and
while
auto
insurance
is
not
needed
on
a
daily
basis
,
we
have
it
do
nt
we
?
second
,
having
a
gun
does
not
lead
to
violence
and
gang
banging
,
having
a
mentality
that
seeks
to
force
your
will
on
another
does
lead
to
gang
banging
and
crime
.
i
have
had
guns
my
entire
life
and
never
had
one
ounce
of
desire
to
harm
another
.
and
if
you
actually
think
countries
that
have
banned
guns
have
less
crime
,
try
living
in
one
.
new
york
and
washington
dc
are
hotbeds
of
violence
and
murder
and
they
do
nt
like
regular
folks
to
own
guns
.
i
will
also
prove
my
point
to
you
:
where
have
you
heard
of
nationally
famous
shootings
?
columbine
and
virginny
tech
as
well
as
ohio
.
guess
what
,
they
were
"
gun
free
zones
"
and
idiots
demanded
gun
bans
when
bans
had
failed
.
where
have
you
never
ever
heard
of
a
gun
rampage
?
gun
shows
.
that
says
something
.
<new_line>
peace
for
a
while
?
is
that
why
we
have
had
wars
globally
for
thousands
of
years
before
guns
were
invented
?
is
that
why
schools
and
churches
are
shot
to
pieces
and
gun
shows
are
not
?
<new_line>
so
truuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuue
.
<new_line>
crime
and
stupid
people
are
such
a
bad
thing
.
the
world
would
be
so
much
better
without
either
,
and
the
rest
of
us
could
own
entire
armories
and
never
have
a
problem
.
<new_line>
japan
is
also
a
dictatorship
where
they
work
people
to
death
and
where
if
you
"
dishonor
"
someone
your
head
comes
off
.
go
live
there
,
at
least
there
are
no
guns
!
<new_line>
criminals
kill
people
.
let
's
ban
them
.
real
affective
huh
?
guess
what
dude
,
i
have
many
guns
and
i
've
never
hurt
a
soul
.
phooey
with
your
little
ban
daydream
.
<new_line>
guns
do
nt
create
violence
.
they
are
made
of
metal
and
can
not
kill
anything
.
if
your
logic
is
true
then
carfs
cause
drunk
driving
.
in
england
,
they
not
only
prosecute
anyone
for
defending
themselves
,
they
also
pay
the
criminals
for
their
defense
.
you
could
not
pay
me
to
live
in
england
.
by
the
way
,
there
were
centureis
where
guns
did
not
exist
,
yet
people
felt
the
need
to
defend
themselves
.
why
do
you
think
that
is
?
because
the
mind
of
the
criminal
is
the
problem
,
not
the
gun
.
no
,
guns
should
not
be
banned
,
and
the
day
you
face
a
violent
attacker
you
will
learn
that
the
hard
way
.
<new_line>
sure
,
if
guns
were
banned
it
would
be
hard
to
get
them
,
kind
of
like
it
is
hard
to
get
a
joint
,
hard
to
get
cocaine
,
hard
to
get
crack
......
bull
!
there
are
two
things
that
make
a
gun
dangerous
,
a
stupid
person
or
an
evil
one
.
the
rest
of
us
own
guns
,
work
and
live
around
people
who
do
nt
know
we
have
them
and
we
do
just
fine
.
for
all
you
know
you
've
been
around
fifty
people
today
who
had
a
piece
on
them
and
you
are
alive
right
now
because
non
of
them
were
criminals
.
one
criminal
,
and
gun
or
not
,
you
'd
be
in
deep
doo
doo
.
<new_line>
then
cars
should
be
banned
because
they
are
using
drunk
drivers
to
kill
people
every
weekend
.
and
i
betcha
plenty
of
those
drunk
driving
murderers
would
not
own
a
gun
because
they
think
it
is
too
dangerous
.
<new_line>
yes
we
need
to
ban
guns
.
and
while
we
are
at
it
we
need
to
ban
cars
because
in
drunk
driving
accidents
they
kill
people
.
while
we
are
at
it
we
need
to
ban
murder
,
rape
robbery
incest
child
battery
wife
battery
dead
batteries
school
shooting
,
drugs
family
violence
,
....
oh
wait
,
those
things
have
been
banned
for
centuries
.
well
then
they
must
not
exist
......
wait
a
minute
,
what
s
wrong
with
this
picture
?
?
<new_line>
the
data
is
irrefutable
.
countries
that
ban
guns
or
implement
stricter
laws
concerning
firearms
have
lower
crime
rates
.
<new_line>
while
you
may
be
right
to
assert
that
"
guns
do
n't
kill
people
,
people
kill
people
,
"
it
is
pure
sophistry
to
assume
that
therefore
people
should
carry
guns
.
people
do
in
fact
kill
people
,
and
they
do
it
a
lot
easier
with
the
help
of
guns
.
<new_line>
the
right
to
own
a
weapon
is
not
,
nor
should
it
be
,
a
fundamental
right
.
if
there
were
no
consequences
to
gun
ownership
,
i
would
certainly
support
allowing
all
guns
everywhere
.
but
there
are
consequences
.
guns
kill
people
just
like
fists
kill
people
,
except
it
is
much
easier
to
erroneously
kill
/
injure
with
a
gun
.
i
dispute
the
claim
of
self
-
defense
rights
.
it
is
indisputably
safer
to
not
own
a
gun
than
to
own
a
gun
,
save
for
the
rare
case
when
the
area
is
so
dangerous
that
using
the
gun
to
save
oneself
is
statistically
more
likely
than
using
it
to
kill
oneself
/
others
,
on
accident
or
otherwise
.
and
all
of
these
special
cases
exist
only
because
guns
exist
in
the
first
place
.
remove
them
all
and
violence
drops
dramatically
(
after
all
,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
drive
-
by
knife
fight
)
.
the
mission
to
remove
guns
from
the
streets
is
akin
to
the
drive
to
promote
world
peace
.
in
fact
,
they
are
essentially
the
same
thing
.
although
promoting
peace
can
have
consequences
(
often
,
it
creates
conflict
)
the
less
war
there
is
the
better
.
it
is
the
same
with
guns
.
the
unique
factor
that
makes
guns
,
like
war
,
so
worth
fighting
against
is
that
they
cause
significant
collateral
damage
.
they
fuel
drug
cartel
violence
,
they
contribute
to
accidental
deaths
and
suicides
,
and
they
often
kill
innocent
bystandards
.
other
weapons
?
not
so
much
.
the
attempt
to
ban
guns
begins
at
the
supreme
court
.
the
2nd
ammendment
must
be
re
-
interpreted
under
its
primary
intention
,
"
militia
.
"
militia
,
in
today
's
speak
,
means
locally
stationed
military
,
or
just
military
.
if
reinterpreted
correctly
,
this
law
does
not
protect
gun
owners
.
next
,
the
federal
government
would
coordinate
with
states
to
completely
eliminate
all
production
of
new
guns
in
the
country
,
and
ban
the
importation
.
this
would
stifle
the
supply
to
almost
zero
.
finally
,
gun
buyback
programs
and
phased
-
in
laws
against
gun
ownership
would
slowly
remove
the
remaining
guns
.
this
would
require
a
lot
of
effort
,
and
a
lot
of
redneck
outrage
,
but
it
would
all
be
worth
it
in
the
long
run
.
to
the
few
people
every
year
who
get
attacked
by
people
and
theroretically
could
have
saved
themselves
if
they
had
a
gun
(
and
also
the
assailant
did
not
have
a
gun
(
and
the
victim
could
not
have
just
defended
with
a
knife
)
)
,
sorry
.
you
will
die
,
but
for
the
benefit
of
millions
of
victims
and
victims
'
families
.
i
conclude
with
this
statement
:
the
less
opportunities
we
have
to
kill
,
the
less
we
do
.
<new_line>
simple
facts
u
guys
are
killing
your
own
people
...
of
course
u
have
the
problem
of
having
a
huge
influence
by
money
in
all
your
politics
...
so
getting
it
banned
...
do
n't
think
its
feasable
...
allas
...
still
in
europe
where
gun
laws
are
very
strict
...
the
incidents
....
are
not
even
near
your
safest
city
..
and
that
our
top
estimate
..
fact
criminals
with
evil
intent
will
always
be
able
2
fabricate
purchase
or
acquire
a
weapon
..
good
thing
here
if
some1
gets
in
a
shooting
incident
its
mostly
liquidations
ie
criminal
shooting
criminal
so
good
riddance
the
not
having
the
availability
and
ease
of
acquiring
fire
arms
..
does
reflect
in
the
figures
ladies
...
but
then
we
have
a
free
health
care
2
which
saves
lives
..
think
the
mentality
of
the
us
is
not
at
the
moment
saving
lives
or
the
care
of
it
reflected
..
in
gun
laws
health
care
..
food
industry
..
etc
...
u
guys
are
fucked
basically
..
until
you
yourself
decide
2
make
some
fundamental
chances
....
don't
give
me
this
crap
about
democracy
and
free
dom
...
as
yar
living
in
a
2
party
system
..
and
no
i
ai
n't
a
commy
..
:)
its
egocentric
group
behavior
what
s
killing
..
people
...
and
sheep
behavior
...
oh
he
has
a
gun
beeeeeeeh
beeeeeh
i
get
1
no
better
i
get
2
beeeeeeeeh
behh
..
and
so
ya
all
fall
down
the
trap
...
gl
on
yas
<new_line>
i
do
n't
believe
they
should
ban
guns
i
think
if
everyone
in
the
world
had
a
gun
there
would
be
less
crime
.
but
for
all
the
#
haters
out
there
let
me
put
it
this
way
.
saying
."oh
guns
do
n't
kill
but
bullets
do
.
"
is
like
saying
,
"
oh
i
did
n't
rape
her
but
my
dick
did
.
''
drop
the
whole
subject
people
like
you
#
haters
are
targeting
the
wrong
people
the
people
who
take
the
proper
step
in
to
receiving
that
right
to
carry
are
not
the
ones
to
go
after
its
the
mofos
down
the
ally
way
that
think
that
this
is
still
high
school
in
the
real
world
and
wanna
play
on
a
team
(
aka
gang
)
so
get
off
the
asses
of
those
who
obtain
a
proper
permit
and
respect
the
fact
that
those
people
are
the
ones
who
would
prolly
put
their
life
's
on
the
line
for
all
you
baby
's
out
there
who
are
getting
held
up
in
a
bank
laying
on
the
ground
crying
because
the
lady
next
to
you
has
a
bullet
in
her
head
and
the
only
one
in
the
room
with
a
gun
that
you
know
of
is
the
guys
killing
people
.
think
about
it
that
way
sure
you
can
take
the
guns
away
from
the
good
guys
but
can
you
take
them
away
from
the
bad
guys
......
<new_line>
ya
look
these
kids
were
messed
up
.......
and
got
there
hands
on
guns
anyway
but
look
at
it
like
this
.
had
every
teacher
,
janitor
,
principal
,
etc
in
that
building
had
a
gun
how
many
peoples
life
's
would
have
been
saved
?
?
<new_line>
saying
,
"
.
"
is
like
saying,"i
say
that
people
should
be
banned
because
they
are
killing
thousands
of
people
each
week
<new_line>
so
you
believe
that
everyone
in
the
world
having
a
gun
would
,
essentially
,
lessen
crime
?
everyone
includes
criminals
,
thus
it
will
make
it
far
easier
for
them
to
commit
crimes
and
murders
.
 
neither
guns
nor
bullets
kill
people
.
people
kill
people
.
<new_line>
okay
i
am
willing
to
reason
with
you
lets
do
a
for
instince
.
badguy
:
walks
into
a
store
full
of
12
people
.
carring
a
springfeild
xd40
sub
compact
okay
he
only
has
1
clip
1
clip
holds
9
rounds
!
everyone
in
the
store
has
a
gun
too
and
want
to
live
!
!
badguy
:
shoots
1
person
?
:
how
many
of
those
11
people
are
going
to
shoot
each
other
?
that
makes
it
1vs11
now
what
's
the
badguy
going
to
do
.
<new_line>
i
'll
preface
this
by
saying
that
i
have
never
in
my
life
felt
unsafe
or
afraid
in
my
day
to
day
comings
and
goings
any
where
i
have
lived
.
i
do
n't
carry
a
concealed
handgun
because
of
a
fearful
existence
or
paranoia
.
i
also
do
not
have
a
"
commando
complex
"
which
would
make
me
one
of
the
worst
kind
of
wannabes
seeing
i
have
never
served
in
the
military
or
law
enforcement
.
i
actually
do
not
have
any
desire
to
use
the
gun
on
anyone
and
pray
i
never
have
to
pull
it
for
any
reason
.
 
i
do
n't
place
myself
in
dangerous
situations
or
go
places
where
i
think
danger
may
be
present
.
in
other
words
,
my
primary
form
of
self
defense
is
avoidance
of
potential
danger
,
not
confrontation
.
 
that
does
not
make
me
a
coward
,
because
i
have
inadvertently
and
unintentionally
found
myself
in
situations
where
i
have
had
to
step
in
to
defend
other
people
(
without
a
firearm
)
,
and
i
have
responded
pro
-
actively
and
decisively
.
 
so
setting
aside
those
common
accusations
against
people
who
carry
concealed
handguns
,
why
do
i
carry
one
?
 
1
.
because
i
can
.
it
is
a
right
afforded
to
me
by
the
u.s
.
constitution
and
the
arkansas
state
constitution
.
it
is
afforded
to
me
by
a
concealed
carry
law
that
law
abiding
citizens
should
never
have
had
to
fight
for
.
 
nonetheless
,
it
has
been
hard
won
through
long
and
expensive
legislative
action
to
develop
what
we
have
today
.
it
is
a
right
and
the
more
of
us
who
obtain
the
license
and
carry
the
guns
,
the
harder
it
will
be
for
controlling
politicians
to
reverse
it
in
the
future
.
 
2
.
because
it
is
my
duty
and
responsibility
to
take
advantage
of
a
right
afforded
to
me
by
what
i
believe
was
the
guiding
hand
of
an
almighty
god
in
the
framing
of
the
constitution
of
the
u.s
.
and
the
bill
of
rights
.
 
3
.
because
i
choose
to
take
responsibilityy
for
my
and
my
family
's
safety
.
police
generally
arrive
at
a
crime
scene
after
the
criminals
are
long
gone
and
the
devastation
to
citizen
victims
is
already
done
.
it
is
foolish
indeed
to
believe
that
that
our
civil
governments
have
the
ability
to
protect
us
from
the
sub
human
predators
of
our
society
.
 
4
.
because
i
live
in
a
real
world
in
which
i
recognize
the
dangers
above
are
present
.
to
do
otherwise
is
to
stick
our
heads
in
the
sand
and
ignore
an
ever
-
present
danger
among
us
.
 
5
.
because
i
want
to
be
part
of
what
makes
criminals
wonder
if
the
next
person
they
choose
to
assault
may
be
the
one
that
ends
their
life
.
the
more
law
abiding
citizens
that
are
armed
,
the
less
sure
criminals
can
be
of
the
outcome
of
their
actions
against
us
.
<new_line>
i
can
hardly
understand
how
this
is
not
obvious
,
you
have
lost
an
unknown
number
of
normal
people
today
at
a
cinema
screening
.
that
should
not
be
allowed
to
happen
so
easily
,
how
can
america
let
it
?
i
have
seen
comments
in
the
news
feed
which
suggest
that
this
is
not
a
suprise
for
the
area
!
my
mind
boggles
,
if
someone
is
shot
it
should
be
a
suprise
!
if
you
did
not
do
everything
humanly
possible
to
prevent
the
possiblility
that
someone
with
the
capacity
to
kill
could
have
hold
of
a
weapon
with
that
capability
then
that
is
ridiculous
.
if
the
sacrifice
you
have
to
make
is
to
hand
over
a
gun
which
you
ca
nt
prove
you
need
for
any
good
reason
enough
to
keep
it
then
that
is
a
small
price
if
it
might
save
one
life
.
the
right
to
arms
is
out
of
date
,
just
because
people
have
them
already
is
a
weak
excuse
,
maybe
it
will
take
20
years
to
get
it
in
order
but
every
year
will
be
a
bit
safer
than
the
last
.
if
you
have
a
gun
in
your
bag
then
that
suggests
you
would
consider
using
it
,
taking
a
life
is
a
big
deal
,
what
if
you
missed
,
shot
in
a
struggle
through
a
window
,
or
across
the
road
.
guns
kill
because
if
point
your
fingers
and
say
bang
nobody
dies
.
if
you
have
a
gun
to
protect
yourself
its
a
good
bet
that
your
attacker
has
one
too
,
maybe
if
they
were
banned
then
they
would
nt
have
one
...
or
so
much
confidence
.
hand
in
your
weapons
because
every
time
someone
is
shot
you
know
it
might
just
have
been
prevented
.
<new_line>
so
you
are
suggesting
that
in
the
event
of
an
attack
the
streets
of
australia
should
be
filled
with
gun
wielding
civilians
with
no
training
of
street
warfare
,
no
particular
leaders
,
just
whoever
fancies
killing
some
people
runs
about
getting
into
their
neighbours
crossfire
as
they
shoot
from
the
coffee
shop
at
anyone
who
moves
?
odd
that
seems
like
chaos
.
if
gun
violence
went
down
then
that
s
a
step
in
the
right
direction
for
violence
overall
.
<new_line>
the
easier
it
is
to
get
hold
of
guns
,
the
greater
the
likelihood
of
people
being
fatally
shot
.
i
realise
that
criminals
and
mentally
afflicted
people
are
unable
to
own
guns
legally
,
but
since
you
ca
n't
predict
who
is
going
to
commit
a
crime
or
develop
a
mental
illness
in
the
future
,
that
does
n't
offer
much
protection
if
somebody
suddenly
has
a
psychotic
episode
and
goes
on
a
killing
spree
.
<new_line>
the
difference
is
that
a
guns
purpose
is
to
kill
while
a
big
macs
is
to
eat
,
a
knives
is
to
cut
and
a
cars
is
to
drive
.
i
do
n't
believe
guns
should
be
banned
but
they
should
be
much
harder
to
get
<new_line>
in
singapore
we
do
n't
have
peoples
going
around
on
killing
spree
!
!
!
<new_line>
okay
ingenious
,
let
's
think
about
this
.
so
your
going
to
keep
law
-
biding
citizens
from
accessing
guns
so
all
the
law
breakers
can
go
out
and
shoot
all
the
law
-
biding
citizens
just
to
simply
protect
the
estimated
5,000
people
from
getting
killed
by
gun
shot
wounds
,
when
really
you
just
killed
those
5,000
people
along
with
the
other
500,000
people
that
we
're
law
-

<new_line>
yes
,
that
is
certainly
going
to
stop
you
from
a
gunman
.
"
dear
god
....
please
save
this
soul
"
<new_line>
sorry
but
that
is
bull
.
guns
are
already
written
into
our
history
and
there
's
no
going
back
after
over
200
years
of
supporting
guns
just
because
some
people
who
were
n't
properly
trained
in
the
use
and
safety
of
properly
handling
a
firearm
.
if
guns
are
taken
off
the
market
it
wo
nt
stop
people
who
seek
to
cause
trouble
get
their
hands
on
a
gun
,
yes
it
may
make
it
a
little
more
difficult
but
in
the
end
you
are
just
disarming
good
citizens
who
no
longer
have
the
ability
to
defend
themselves
.
and
people
own
guns
for
more
than
the
two
reasons
you
listed
.
i
own
a
rifle
for
hunting
,
shotgun
for
bird
season
,
sidearm
for
personal
defense
,
another
sidearm
for
just
shooting
and
a
22
.
rifle
for
the
same
reason
.
people
have
been
killing
since
the
beginning
of
time
,
before
it
was
guns
it
was
swords
,
blunt
weapons
,
bows
,
hell
even
rocks
and
bones
.
eventually
the
primary
source
of
inflicting
harm
could
be
another
weapon
or
stay
at
the
gun
.
my
point
is
just
outlawing
one
thing
does
n't
mean
others
wo
nt
find
other
ways
of
hurting
one
another
.
<new_line>
ok
anti
-
gunners
,
imagine
this
situation
,
a
mass
murderer
is
looking
for
a
college
to
attack
.
he
sees
two
different
colleges
.
a
sign
on
the
first
college
says
gun
free
zone
,
and
a
sign
on
the
second
college
says
armed
staff
and
students
.
what
college
do
you
think
he
's
going
to
pick
.
<new_line>
does
that
means
the
freedom
of
speech
should
be
banned
what
about
religion
and
right
to
an
attorney
i
guess
that
means
we
should
n't
have
any
of
these
either
.
actually
violent
crime
rates
are
going
down
will
more
an
more
people
are
owning
guns
.
<new_line>
maybe
in
america
but
its
like
smuggling
marijuana
it
hapens
even
though
it
is
illegal
here
.
criminals
would
still
get
gun
and
weapons
no
matter
what
the
law
.
<new_line>
i
find
america
's
obsession
with
guns
fascinating
.
because
the
founders
of
your
country
wrote
a
document
hundreds
of
years
ago
stating
that
everybody
has
the
right
to
bear
arms
means
that
this
document
can
not
be
challenged
to
suit
a
modern
era
many
years
later
?
what
makes
this
constitution
infallible
other
than
how
much
importance
is
placed
on
its
merits
by
the
people
?
no
single
document
or
set
of
laws
is
infallible
.
basic
logic
.
the
fact
is
there
is
a
strong
correlation
between
legal
guns
and
higher
homicide
rates
.
more
americans
are
killed
by
guns
every
year
than
all
other
developed
countries
combined
.
no
problems
with
guns
i
hear
you
say
?
also
,
inb4
"
some
countries
where
it
is
legal
to
obtain
guns
have
low
crime
rates
"
.
using
a
few
examples
to
justify
a
larger
picture
painted
by
the
correlation
between
gun
ownership
and
higher
homicide
rates
is
intellectually
dishonest
debate
fodder
.
and
quite
frankly
,
i
am
sick
of
hearing
the
tired
old
phrase
"
guns
do
n't
kill
people
-
people
do
"
.
yeah
,
people
kill
people
.
but
what
are
my
chances
of
going
on
a
murder
spree
using
a
screwdriver
vs
a
loaded
gun
?
idiots
.
<new_line>
stupid
argument
.
you
're
using
an
extreme
example
to
demonstrate
the
legitimacy
of
gun
ownership
?
i
can
chop
and
screw
your
argument
down
to
make
it
more
complex
,
as
you
should
have
done
from
the
very
beginning
anyway
.
1
)
a
mass
murder
will
have
some
form
of
mental
psychosis
,
or
history
of
violence
.
this
means
that
in
a
state
/
country
where
it
is
required
by
law
to
have
a
full
medical
and
criminal
background
check
cleared
in
order
to
obtain
a
license
to
yield
a
weapon
,
this
mass
murderer
would
n't
have
a
chance
at
obtaining
a
gun
in
the
first
place
.
ban
guns
altogether
?
they
'd
have
to
turn
to
the
black
market
.
and
this
is
n't
an
easy
process
,
either
.
2
)
let
's
say
where
this
man
lives
,
guns
are
banned
.
if
he
wants
to
go
on
a
killing
spree
he
would
have
to
be
extremely
dedicated
to
the
cause
.
whether
or
not
he
obtains
a
gun
,
this
guy
is
clearly
dangerous
and
will
kill
with
any
means
necessary
.

)
there
are
more
incidences
of
school
shoot
outs
in
america
compared
to
any
other
developed
country
in
the
world
.
what
is
the
difference
between
america
and
the
uk
,
australia
or
canada
?
well
let
's
see
here
...
oh
yeah
.
guns
.

"
guns
do
n't
kill
people
,
people
do
"
.
hm
?
of
course
-
a
gun
is
an
inanimate
object
.
however
,
missing
the
big
picture
here
.
more
guns
=
higher
homicide
rates
.
less
guns
=
lower
homicide
rates
.
are
americans
just
more
violent
by
nature
or
are
you
too
hung
up
on
your
2nd
amendment
rights
to
acknowledge
there
is
a
problem
with
guns
?
<new_line>
no
!
if
this
were
to
happen
that
would
be
a
major
infringement
on
our
second
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
.
with
more
armed
citizens
,
that
could
deter
criminals
from
committing
crimes
.
more
armed
citizens
make
the
country
safer
.
<new_line>
i
absolutly
think
there
is
.
how
many
prior
service
members
are
in
the
us
right
now
.
way
more
than
active
duty
.
<new_line>
guns
do
kill
people
but
they
save
many
more
lives
than
they
kill
.
also
some
people
get
alot
of
food
that
they
need
form
hunting
.
you
ban
this
you
kill
them
.
<new_line>
if
guns
were
banned
then
criminals
would
go
to
knives
and
or
crossbows
,
would
you
ban
those
too
?
<new_line>
if
you
look
at
all
these
horrific
mass
shootings
,
like
columbine
,
virginia
tech
,
and
the
colorado
theater
shooting
,
what
did
they
all
have
in
common
?
they
were
all
gun
-
free
zones
.
meaning
that
only
those
who
care
about
laws
will
follow
them
.
<new_line>
removing
guns
from
house
hold
is
the
worse
thing
you
can
do
.
let
me
tell
you
exactly
why
as
a
information
security
engineer
(
info
sec
/
it
sec
)
.
1
)
law
abiding
citizen
will
obey
the
law
.
regardless
if
you
want
guns
or
not
,
criminals
have
ways
to
find
one
and
kill
you
.
2
)
guns
equalize
the
situation
where
cops
will
take
5
minutes
minimum
to
bring
some
body
bags
to
your
house
.
you
either
want
to
use
that
body
bag
or
you
do
n't
.
3
)
guns
in
america
was
not
meant
for
hunting
as
a
primary
purpose
.
it
is
your
second
amendment
right
/
duty
to
have
one
as
our
founding
fathers
have
seen
how
government
abuses
its
power
to
fellow
citizens
.
government
should
serve
people
,
not
the
other
way
around
.
4
)
people
kill
people
,
not
tools
kill
people
.
you
say
all
you
want
that
these
equipment
make
it
easier
for
bad
people
to
do
harmful
things
.
however
,
would
you
also
want
to
get
rid
of
chances
for
law
abiding
citizen
to
defense
themselves
.
if
you
say
the
cops
can
do
it
then
you
are
delusional
.
they
do
n't
have
the
jurisdiction
to
even
search
you
or
run
to
your
house
to
do
things
on
your
property
.
go
find
out
about
the
law
.
5
)
countries
that
have
extremely
strict
gun
laws
do
n't
really
work
well
either
.
japan
still
has
high
crime
rates
,
they
just
hide
their
news
.
people
still
kill
each
other
in
many
different
ways
.
6
)
i
do
agree
with
fully
automatic
weapons
can
be
ridiculous
since
you
can
not
hit
anything
accurately
and
should
just
spread
the
harm
.
however
,
having
a
regular
semi
-
automatic
firearms
should
not
be
excluded
in
any
state
or
the
country
.
i
suggest
you
go
learn
about
firearms
really
well
before
you
say
stuff
.
7
)
law
enforcement
do
agree
that
black
rifles
do
not
create
crimes
.
crimes
were
made
by
people
who
ca
n't
afford
to
have
anything
.
they
purchased
cheap
crappy
firearms
in
black
market
anyway
.
all
can
all
.
i
know
that
the
bad
guys
will
go
to
your
house
not
mine
for
sure
.
why
?
because
i
am
ready
to
defend
myself
and
my
family
for
the
right
of
life
and
freedom
of
speech
.
do
you
like
commie
countries
?
you
can
go
to
china
and
see
how
that
feels
.
educate
your
children
about
firearms
and
proper
manner
in
society
is
the
key
.
firearms
are
not
the
problem
.
us
government
themselves
deals
more
than
any
other
agencies
in
the
world
.
go
figure
!
<new_line>
phuqster
,
you
have
to
understand
that
it
was
created
to
defend
yourself
for
thugs
,
including
the
evil
government
.
so
you
really
think
that
what
is
available
is
evil
vs
what
is
available
in
military
?
go
figure
.
only
stupid
,
ignorant
,
selfish
,
crazy
people
kill
fellow
citizens
.
with
those
,
they
would
be
put
away
anyways
.
i
also
support
shoot
on
the
spot
if
you
see
a
killing
spree
or
someone
is
robing
a
bank
.
i
think
that
would
work
really
well
.
<new_line>
yeah
,
cause
british
people
kill
each
other
with
something
else
.
look
,
guns
or
no
guns
,
people
will
die
just
as
much
.
killed
by
guns
or
killed
by
knife
,
fork
,
poison
,
cars
,
rope
,
does
n't
really
matter
.
culture
is
also
very
important
.
i
was
living
in
asia
for
12
years
,
still
as
much
killing
as
over
here
with
some
other
type
of
murder
weapons
.
i
do
n't
see
the
point
.
<new_line>
i
do
n't
hunt
or
kill
any
life
shape
or
form
with
any
thing
that
i
own
with
.
however
,
banning
a
type
of
rifle
is
really
just
ignorant
to
the
max
.
you
should
learn
about
firearms
a
lot
more
before
you
say
something
like
ar
,
ak-47
,
whatever
.
it
's
all
about
the
rate
of
fire
and
mechanism
of
the
gun
.
it
's
how
its
made
for
philosophy
of
use
(
pou
)
.
you
can
not
just
ban
anything
in
general
because
you
do
not
understand
how
anything
works
at
all
.
all
rifle
models
including
ar
,
ak
,
sig
,
etc
,
are
made
with
semi
-
automatic
version
for
civilian
use
.
i
also
never
like
or
believe
in
fully
auto
weapon
,
they
are
not
accurate
,
waste
of
ammo
,
and
much
harder
to
shoot
.
i
never
shot
one
,
but
shooting
2
rounds
consecutively
would
already
give
me
an
idea
.
please
learn
more
about
firearms
and
safety
of
it
before
you
go
out
and
stay
stuff
like
this
.
it
is
not
true
at
all
.
<new_line>
so
you
do
n't
hurt
plants
with
your
shoes
?
<new_line>
you
're
a
moron
.
bad
guys
will
always
have
guns
.
hence
bad
guys
.
law
abiding
citizens
wo
n't
have
one
if
the
law
said
so
.
hence
law
biding
citizen
.
bad
guys
want
something
and
pull
out
that
piece
pointing
at
law
abiding
citizens
.
2
options
,
citizens
have
guns
and
point
back
.
maybe
bad
guy
have
1
shot
off
,
maybe
not
.
or
,
all
citizens
scream
and
run
,
bad
guy
unloads
on
citizens
.
hmmmmmmmmm
,
sure
,
that
will
work
.
<new_line>
you
're
an
idiot
,
it
happens
in
u.s
.
alllllll
the
time
.
not
just
in
u.s
.
perhaps
,
everywhere
!
shoot
out
in
school
is
a
form
of
violence
.
what
about
gang
fights
between
schools
.
maybe
we
should
ban
school
uniforms
too
.
derb
derb
!
<new_line>
i
my
point
of
view
guns
shoul
be
benned
not
only
in
america
but
in
other
countries
also
.
guns
should
be
used
only
in
military
.
let
us
think
why
nowadays
there
are
a
lot
of
terrorists
,
of
course
because
of
guns
and
other
veapons
.
they
became
available
to
a
society
and
imagine
how
many
families
have
suffered
from
it
,
how
many
mothers
have
losen
their
child
?
but
anyway
they
must
be
used
in
military
only
.
despite
the
fact
that
they
can
damage
someones
life
guns
could
be
the
only
way
to
protect
us
,
what
the
military
is
succesfuly
doing
.
<new_line>
if
nobody
had
guns
,
nobody
could
kill
people
.
no
guns
should
be
able
to
be
sold
over
the
counter
to
anybody
.
if
there
are
to
be
any
guns
,
then
only
to
police
and
the
navy
/
force
.
even
this
,
people
should
have
approved
licenses
.
<new_line>
but
if
guns
got
banned
do
you
think
criminals
who
use
guns
would
just
give
them
to
the
government
?
<new_line>
they
would
get
arrested
if
they
did
n't
,
then
get
killed
if
they
did
n't
.
<new_line>
they
would
have
to
be
found
with
a
gun
first
.
<new_line>
maybe
the
government
of
usa
should
not
prohibit
all
weapons
.
first
the
government
should
get
rid
of
nuclear
weapons
.
united
nations
just
deal
with
this
problem
at
the
moment
.
kazakhstan
leads
the
program
.
more
than
40
nations
,
including
kazakhstan
,
met
in
washington
in
2010
for
the
first
summit
and
again
in
seoul
in
march
2012
.
"
when
the
cold
war
ended
and
the
soviet
union
dissolved
,
kazakhstan
inherited
a
vast
nuclear
weapons
infrastructure
that
included
1,410
nuclear
warheads
.
president
nazarbayev
made
a
“
courageous
and
monumental
decision
”
to
remove
all
of
the
nuclear
weapons
from
the
country
"

limage
is
the
deputy
assistant
secretary
of
state
in
the
state
department
’s
bureau
of
international
security
and

limage
said
the

been

together
and
with
others
to
combat
illicit
trafficking
in
nuclear
and
radiological
materials
through

global

.
i
take
the
view
that
it
is
a
global
problem
,
not
only
in
usa
and
also
world
over
.
i
believe
that
people
are
able
to
protect
the
world
against
nuclear
weapons
.
“
the
united

has
taken
bold
steps
toward
nuclear
disarmament
,
”
limage
said
.
it
is
my
view
this
is
the
most
important
<new_line>
i
think
guns
should
be
banned
but
only
in
public
because
if
guns
were
banned
even
in
homes
then
it
could
be
like
when
they
banned
alcohol
.
people
would
find
ways
to
get
guns
and
hide
them
from
police
.
not
only
would
it
begin
another
prohibition(except
with
guns
)
but
the
black
market
would
have
more
things
to
sell
.
if
we
got
rid
of
guns
then
the
police
could
defend
themselves
easier
<new_line>
i
do
nt
think
guns
should
be
banded
but
i
do
think
we
need
to
get
rid
of
the
black
market
sales
of
guns
i
live
here
in
oklahoma
where
you
can
go
to
the

fair

where
they

show
and
they
do
nt
even
check
back
grounds
or
nothing
that
is
a
bad
loop
hole
in
the
system
and
you
can
buy
a
ar15
ak47
and
so
on
but
if
you
go
in
a
regular
gun
shop
here
you
can
not
buy
that
type
of
weapon
i
think
those
type
of
rifles
should
stay
in
the
military
not
on
the
streets
but
i
also
think
if
people
want
to
carry
or
have
one
in
there
homes
they
should
have
to
go
to
a
mandatory
gun
course
and
it
not
be
very
simple
like
it
is
here
where
i
live
and
get
there
licence
to
beable
to
buy
and
own
one
and
some
type
of
mental
evaluation
this
can
be
all
done
and
probably
costly
but
it
will
make
some
kinda
of
a
difference
because
we
all
need
to
protect
our
self
's
and
i
believe
that
will
help
keep
most
of
the
insane
nuts
from
just
going
out
there
and
being
able
to
buy
one
i
love
my
freedom
and
being
able
to
own
my
guns
and
being
able
to
pack
one
to
protect
my
self
but
i
think
the
laws
are
just
to
loose
just
for
anybody
to
go
in
a
store
and
buy
one
i
know
you
have
to
go
thru
a
backgroung
check
but
to
me
that
s
not
good
enough
because
not
every
body
has
a
felony
record
but
they
still
do
nt
have
any
business
owning
one
and
not
even
capable
of
shooting
one
but
they
just
walk
out
the
door
with
no
training
and
most
of
them
with
no
clue
on
how
to
shoot
one
so
there
s
my
thought
and
opinion
i
m
sure
most
wo
nt
agree
because
they
think
its
an
infringement
on
our
2nd
admitment
right
<new_line>
i
am
surprised
that
nobody
has
said
anything
about
the
jobs
that
would
be
lost
if
they
ban
semi
auto
firearms
.
one
of
the
only
branches
of
business
that
is
flourishing
right
now
.
lets
put
more
people
out
of
work
shall
we
.
back
to
the
task
at
hand
.
most
vehicles
we
drive
in
u.s
.
have
the
capability
to
go
over
100
mph
.
these
vehicles
are
used
every
day
on
roads
that
will
never
legally
allow
you
to
drive
over
80
.
yet
everybody
still
buys
these
100
mph
+
vehicles
.
car
accidents
and
vehicle
related
deaths
by
far
out
weigh
the
firearm
related
deaths
.
why
are
nt
they
banned
and
have
all
of
the
cars
thrown
in
a
big
pit
and
burned
while
we
all
walk
to
work
how
would
that
be
.
of
course
nobody
needs
the
cars
to
go
over
100
mph
.
but
guess
what
we
have
them
.
why
.
because
we
can
.
do
we
really
need
semi
auto
weapons
.
maybe
,
maybe
not
.
but
there
is
more
cause
to
ban
100
+
mph
cars
than
firearms
.
and
by
the
way
all
of
you
idiot
peace
blah
blah
blah
hippies
out
there
.
i
am
an
american
and
i
love
my
cars
that
can
go
over
100
mph
i
love
my
cheeseburgers
and
i
enjoy
shooting
my
semi
auto
firearms
.
not
for
the
soul
purpose
of
killing
people
,
but
for
my
own
personal
enjoyment
.
america
was
built
with
the
understanding
that
a
corrupt
government
would
never
allow
their
"
subjects
"
to
have
firearms
.
why
do
you
think
they
fled
and
came
here
in
the
first
place
.
that
is
why
it
is
important
to
keep
this
right
in
the
constitution
and
not
a
chopped
and
diced
version
that
corrupt
politicians
have
molded
to
suit
there
needs
.
but
a
pure
constitution
that
means
what
it
states
.
that
i
have
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
.
even
semi
auto
rifles
and
handguns
.
<new_line>

are

hurting

they
just
killed
your

what
are

you
are

when

i
'll
give

firearms

until
then
i
'll
defend
my

to
have
them
and
protect
my

.
educate
yourself
.
<new_line>
what
about
the
other
half
?
would
you
want
your
family
in
that
half
?
think
about
that
.
<new_line>
your
a
real

are
n't
you

it
's
people
like
you
who
will
look

when
you
need

<new_line>
why
just
for
a
simple
"
redneck
"
as
you
have
stereo
typed
me
and
my
fellow
gun
owners
,
i
have
to
say
your
an
uneducated
blind
,
ignorant
person
.
people
have
been
doing
evil
things
since
the
beginning
of
time
and
guess
what
the
criminals
have
always
been
armed
with
weapons
that
match
that
time
period
.
and
i
will
be
as
equally
or
better
armed
than
the
people
who
wish
to
do
malicious
things
to
my
family
.
i
will
not
fight
bring
a
kitchen
knife
to
a
gun
fight
.
"unlike
you
"
.
and
the
right
to
own
my
firearms
and
my
right
to
my
second
amendment
was
fought
for
by
my
ancestors
,
which
probably
unlike
you
can
be
traced
to
the
revolutionary
war
.
and
who
are
you
to
reinterpret
the
constitution
?
it
says
what
it
says
for
a
reason
.
not
to
be
ever
changed
by
any
person
or
government
for
any
reason
!
i
conclude
with
this
statement
"
the
strongest
reason
for
the
people
to
retain
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
as
a
last
resort
to
protect
themselves
against
tyranny
in
government
"

<new_line>

if

would

<new_line>
guns
do
n't
kill
people
,
if
they
did
,
they
would
go
to
jail
for
murder-
not
the
murderers
.
jk
they
kill
peoplebut
are
good
for
self
defense
.
if
they
were
illegalized
,
it
would
lead
to
black
market
sales
which
would
lead
to
higher
crime
.
if
it
is
legal
,
the
government
can
use
the
money
to
do
stuff
.
<new_line>
i
know
this
is
an
old
debate
but
in
light
of
today
's
events
in
connecticut
i
have
been
doing
a
little
poking
around
on
the
internet
and
came
across
this
...
here
's
my
thought
-
criminals
and
anyone
who
wants
to
get
their
hands
on
a
gun
,
any
gun
,
can
and
will
.
they
do
n't
care
that
guns
are
outlawed
-
in
fact
,
that
spurs
some
people
on
to
have
one
just
because
the
government
says
they
ca
n't
.
what
,
do
we
think
that
a
criminal
is
going
to
sigh
,
throw
up
their
hands
and
say
"
gee
,
i
guess
i
ca
n't
own
a
gun
-
got
ta
find
something
more
productive
and
socially
acceptable
to
do
...
"
no
,
in
fact
-
if
we
ban
guns
i
believe
the
criminals
are
going
to
rejoice
because
it
gives
them
an
upper
hand
when
committing
their
crimes
.
look
at
drugs
-
they
are
outlawed
and
banned
but
our
children
today
are
still
dying
from
overdoses
because
drugs
are
still
on
the
street
.
it
did
n't
deter
criminals
from
owning
,
using
or
distributing
it
.
it
will
be
the
same
with
guns
.
tighter
control
-
perhaps
-
but
until
you
can
guarantee
that
no
one
,
ever
again
,
will
be
able
to
have
a
gun
in
their
hands
when
coming
into
contact
with
me
,
i
say
we
ca
n't
ban
guns
!
<new_line>
attempting
to
use
the
logic
that
guns
should
be
outlawed
solely
based
on
the
fact
that
they
make
it
easier
to
commit
crimes
and
are
involved
in
such
a
high
number
of
crimes
and
deaths
each
year
has
me
wondering
what
these
same
people
would
say
about
alcohol
.
alcohol
ranks
higher
than
guns
in
both
categories
.
<new_line>
imagine
a
society
in
which
only
the
police
and
higher
authoritites
have
guns
.
people
are
greedy
and
will
overstep
their
privilages
.
even
though
polices
officer
's
duty
is
to
help
,
their
are
cops
who
break
the
law
.
and
what
can
we
do
if
they
're
the
only
ones
who
have
guns
?
nothing
.
also
,
if
the
government
tried
taking
over
there
would
be
more
then
just
one
person
to
stop
.
militia
would
form
and
revolt
.
if
guns
were
banned
it
would
do
nothing
to
stop
crime
.
a
good
example
of
this
is
marijuana
.
yea
,
its
illegal
says
the
federal
government
,
but
just
about
anybody
who
wants
to
smoke
pot
does
.
people
will
get
a
hold
of
guns
one
way
or
another
so
why
bann
them
and
waste
time
and
effort
getting
rid
of
them
.
<new_line>
guns
have
the
sole
intention
to
kill
people
.
rather
than
this
guns
are
n't
used
for
anything
else
.
while
committing
a
murder
with
a
knife
or
a
bat
is
considered
a
misconduct
,
guns
where
only
designed
to
kill
.
knives
and
bats
were
developed
for
other
causes
rather
than
killing
.
but
guns
are
n't
used
in
any
other
way
.
in
addition
guns
are
even
more
lethal
than
knives
because
one
can
accidentally
kill
someone
due
to
uncontrollable
firing
.
this
especially
applies
to
assault
rifles
and
submachine
guns
that
fire
multiple
rounds
per
pulling
the
trigger
.
where
as
with
a
knife
only
one
person
can
be
targeted
.
another
point
for
the
gun
ban
is
that
people
with
criminal
intentions
can
easily
get
access
to
guns
and
weapons
.
america
has
seen
this
during
the
past
20
years
the
gang
violence
the
frequent
gun
-
related
homicides
and
the
brutal
massacres
such
as
columbine
,
virginia
tech
and
now
new
town
connecticut
.
by
giving
these
people
(
or
any
people
at
all
)
access
to
these
weapons
multiple
people
can
be
killed
in
just
a
matter
of
seconds
and
most
importantly
guns
can
be
acquired
legally
.
but
for
what
cause
?
what
could
you
possibly
need
a
gun
for
?
for
hunting
but
only
with
a
license
and
any
deliberate
murder
would
be
considered
a
misconduct
because
hunting
rifles
where
intended
to
kill
animals
and
that
is
a
legitimate
cause
for
killing
.
but
since
cannibalism
is
extremely
scarce
people
say
they
need
guns
for
protection
.
but
from
what
?
there
's
the
police
there
's
the
fbi
that
protect
but
just
normal
residents
why
do
they
need
guns
.
every
single
time
people
have
a
conflict
they
do
n't
try
to
peacefully
solve
the
problem
.
a
lot
of
them
would
just
go
crazy
,
grab
their
gun
and
start
shooting
at
the
other
person
they
were
having
their
conflict
with
.
if
they
would
n't
have
guns
they
might
think
two
more
times
before
reverting
to
the
gun
.
people
always
think
violence
is
the
answer
i
can
assure
you
it
is
n't
and
those
that
think
violence
is
n't
caused
by
guns
but
by
people
they
should
know
that
guns
foster
this
violence
and
even
intensify
it
on
a
catastrophic
scale
.
the
worst
part
of
all
is
that
because
of
the
gun
sales
and
the
simplicity
of
acquiring
a
weapon
,
criminal
organizations
are
heavily
benefiting
from
this
as
well
.
the
sinaloa
cartel
and
various
street
gangs
can
simply
order
people
to
purchase
weapons
for
them
.
if
the
opportunity
were
n't
there
it
would
be
much
more
difficult
for
criminal
organizations
to
acquire
them
.
however
criminal
organizations
can
still
smuggle
weapons
and
get
assault
weapons
but
the
ban
on
weapons
could
lower
the
murder
rate
and
hinder
organizations
from
bulking
up
with
annihilating
firepower
.
we
should
act
fast
and
realize
that
we
are
protecting
ourselves
from
the
same
thing
that
is
supposed
to
protect
us
.
guns
are
wrong
and
we
need
to
find
an
alternative
method
.
the
constant
killing
has
got
to
stop
!
<new_line>
as
a
human
i
am
disgusted
as
to
the
fact
that
people
still
want
to
buy
guns
despite
the
amount
of
death
they
cause
.
first
let
me
say
i
am
not
against
the
sale
of
select
weapons
for
hunting
and
farmers
but
no
one
else
needs
weapons
and
certainly
no
one
needs
fully
automatic
carbines
or
12
gauge
shotguns
,
why
would
anyone
need
weapons
that
are
close
to
and
are
in
some
cases
military
grade
?
?
the
line
"
guns
do
n't
kill
people
,
people
do
"
is
quite
ridiculous
as
an
argument
for
gun
sales
since
it
is
"
people
"
that
the
guns
are
being
sold
to
!
!
it
is
just
a
case
of
prevention
,
remove
guns
being
so
easily
accessible
and
you
then
decrease
the
gun
crime
and
remove
the
need
for
guns
to
defend
yourself
.
this
is
common
sense
,
it
's
the
reason
why
no
countries
are
now
allowed
to
make
nuclear
weapons
,
to
say
people
deserve
guns
do
defend
themselves
is
to
say
places
like
iran
and
north
korea
should
be
able
to
make
nuclear
weapons
to
defend
themselves
and
if
you
think
that
then
clearly
something
is
wrong
<new_line>
no
.

<new_line>
typically
it
is
the
maniacs
who
own
the
guns
who
kill
people
.
sometimes
,
other
methods
of
killing
are
used
and
have
larger
effects
.
for
example
,
millions
of
jews
were
killed
during
the
holocaust
,
sometimes
with
guns
,
but
more
times
than
not
they
were
killed
by
poison
.
sometimes
,
bombs
or
blades
are
used
more
than
guns
.
if
no
one
has
a
gun
,
criminals
will
find
some
way
of
getting
guns
and
killing
the
upstanding
american
citizen
.
<new_line>
i
own
a
gun
!
check
the
news-
i
have
n't
hurt

except
for
the

going

<new_line>
you
want
to
know
why
it
's
so
easy
to
get
drugs
?
because
people
get
addicted
and
need
the
high
,
and
there
is
good
business
behind
it
,
not
to
mention
the
ingredients
for
weed
and
cocaine
grow
in

ground
,
so
there
is
an
unlimited
supply
.
i
completely
agree
that
guns
are
dangerous
in
the
hands
of
an
evil
or
stupid
person
,
but
there
are
also
countless
accounts
of
accidental
shootings
.
point
being
,
guns
are
meant
to
hurt
and
harm
,
regardless
of
who
owns
them
and
for
what
reason
.
i
understand
that
banning
guns
will
not
stop
criminals
from
accessing
them
,
but
it
will
surely
drop
the
crime
rate
and
make
it
much
harder
to
get
a
gun
.
imagine
trying
to
fend
off
someone
who
is
pointing
a
gun
at
you
rather
than
a
knife
,
which
situation
do
you
think
you
'd
have
a
better
chance
of
surviving
?
<new_line>
i
agree
that
gun
should
be
banned
.
guns
are
really
dangerous
,
they
can
kill
people
imediately
and
people
have
sentisive
emotions
.
no
one
can
sure
that
when
we
are
anger
we
can
regulate
ourselves
with
a
gun
belong
.
without
a
gun
,
we
can
fight
him
,
it
does
not
a
big
matter
,
but
when
we
use
guns
,
we
can
not
regret
.
<new_line>
the
illegalization
of
fire
weapons
in
the
usa
is
a
must
!
too
many
innocent
people
have
died
already
please
act
now
!
<new_line>
we
are
not
talking
about
knives
here
...
we
are
talking
about
guns
.
you
have
to
start
fixing
a
society
somewhere
and
eliminating
violence
-
inducing
weapons
is
a
first
and
important
step
<new_line>
with
all
my
respect
,
you
are
mixing
things
up
.
weapons
used
by
the
army
are
a
different
thing
.
weapons
used
for
hunting
animals
are
also
a
different
thing
.
but
selling
to
just
about
anybody
weapons
like
the
ones
i
see
on
tv
sold
in
the
usa
is
simply
outrageous
.
you
are
killing
each
other
!
stop
this
madness
please
<new_line>
that
's
it
.
get
a
gun
for
every
one
...
you
really
have
a
problem
in
the
usa
with
people
supporting
violence
views
such
as
this
one
.
safety
comes
from
goodness
,
trust
,
peace
,
love
,
not
arms
!
<new_line>
let
is
say
that
guns
were
banned
in
america
,
which
would
never
happen
there
are
too
many
gun
lovers
here
.
but
theroeticly
....
wouldbe
criminals
would
get
the
gun(s
)
they
wanted
anyways
.
and
a
cheap
gun
is
easy
to
make
anyways
.
if
guns
were
taken
away
then
they
would
switch
to
that
or
go
with
shooting
people
with
arrows
or
stabbing
.
violence
will
never
be
elliminated
.
this
task
is
impossible
.
yes
according
to
statistics
many
are
killed
by
gun
but
many
more
are
saved
by
them
.
<new_line>
i
am
not
mixing
up
.
many
crimes
are
also
committed
with
guns
that
are
used
for
hunting
.
these
assult
weapons
and
guns
that
are
more
deadly
are
bought
by
collectors
and
sport
shooters
.
the
few
who
get
guns
for
killing
often
pre
-
meditate
.
they
ca
n't
get
the
m16
that
they
saw
on
tv
?
they
will
switch
to
something
else
.
a
boltaction
hunting
rifle
or
another
simiautomatic
rifle
.
i
am
sorry
to
burst
your
bubble
but
killings
like
this
will
never
stop
.
there
are
bad
men
out
there
that
want
to
hurt
others
either
because
they
like
it
,
because
they
got
mad
at
someone
,
or
to
better
them
selves
.
getting
rid
of
assult
weapons
will
do
nothing
.
i
do
though
applaud
you
for
saying
,
with
all
due
respect
.
i
find
few
who
show
some
form
of
respect
on
this
site
.
<new_line>
mass
murderers
should
be
detected
and
treated
.
and
should
not
have
access
to
guns
.
do
n't
you
see
where
the
problem
is
?
<new_line>
you
will
never
end
violence
with
more
violence
.
there
must
be
a
different
approach
.
education
,
detection
of
violent
people
,
information
,
etc
,
etc
but
providing
easy
access
to
guns
is
a
poor
way
of
trying
to
get
a
safe
country
.
in
my
opinion
.
<new_line>
never
end
violence
with
violence
,
ww1
and
ww2
.
there
are
other
approaches
but
many
people
are
impaticent
and
want
to
take
the
easier
way
.
you
ca
n't
allways
detect
violent
people
.
i
am
a
calm
person
,
i
do
n't
get
normaly
get
mad
and
i
do
n't
lash
out
at
people
.
i
follow
rules
.
you
would
know
this
if
you
knew
me
in
person
.
last
year
though
,
in
woods
class
at
school
,
i
was
bullied
and
i
was
driven
to
the
point
where
i
wanted
the
guy
to
die
.
i
delt
with
it
through
words
but
if
it
went
much
further
i
do
n't
know
what
would
have
happened
.
yes
i
guess
that
your
point
,
there
is
a
smarter
way
around
things
but
this
is
america
.
people
do
n't
want
to
get
rid
of
guns
.
i
respect
your
oppion
and
understand
its
points
.
its
just
that
i
choose
the
other
side
.
i
can
see
that
none
of
us
will
budge
;
call
a
truce
on
this
one
?
<new_line>
i
personally
think
our
government
will
use
this
incident
with
help
of
the
press
to
take
our
rights
,
guns
and
put
martial
law
in
effect
.
i
saw
how
the
press
turned
the
public
opinion
from
one
military
conflict
to
another
,
from
baby
killers
in
vietnam
to
hero
's
in
the
conflict
in
iraq
and
afgahanistan
.
china
is
holding
the
loan
papers
on
our
country
and
this
is
the
largest
comminist
country
in
the
world
.
i
think
what
one
mentally
disturbed
individual
did
was
horrible
and
i
pray
for
the
children
and
teachers
,
the
assualt
weapon
did
not
kill
those
people
,
this
could
happen
with
a
revolver
or
a
pump
shotgun
.
please
do
n't
let
what
one
sick
person
did
to
let
our
government
take
our
rights
away
from
us
.
<new_line>
i
believe
we
should
ban
guns
in
america
because
it
's
time
that
we
grow
up
and
stop
believing
we
're
still
living
in
the
wild
west
,
that
we
're
"
top
gun
"
fighters
!
it
's
time
we
snap
out
of
our
fantasies
and
paranoia
fears
that
we
need
more
guns
to
protect
us
from
the
other
guy
when
it
's
pretty
obvious
that
more
people
are
killed
within
the
safety
of
their
own
homes
due
to
accidents
or
domestic
altercations
.
i
agree
with
pres
.
obama
that
the
safety
of
our
children
must
always
comes
first
and
has
priority
over
our
so
-
called
constitutional
rights
to
own
a
gun
.
we
need
to
stop
enabling
serial
killers
who
want
to
go
down
in
a
blaze
of
glory
while
taking
innocent
children
,
men
,
and
women
down
with
them
.
let
's
banned
all
guns
,
or
at
least
assault
weapons
(
the
"
barbie
doll
weapon
with
accessories
!
"
)
.
thank
you

<new_line>
heroin
,
weed
,
coke
,
meth
,
all
of
these
things
are
illegal
but
the
illegal
drug
business
is
worth
over
1
billion
dollars
in
the
us
!
if
a
criminal
wants
a
gun
he
will
get
one
just
like
drugs
.
the
only
thing
that
would
change
is
next
time
someone
decided
to
kill
someone
it
would
be
like
shooting
fish
in
a
barrel
!
we
should
have
a
right
to
defend
ourselves
!
!
!
<new_line>
i
do
n't
believe
that
the
problem
is
weapons
.
the
problem
in
this
nation
is
the
poor
up
bringing
of
children
,
we
have
lost
the
values
that
built
this
great
country
,
we
have
lost
respect
for
human
life
and
forgot
that
we
are
brothers
and
sisters
in
humanity
and
the
channels
of
communication
have
been
shadowed
by
violence
and
newer
generations
that
only
believe
in
the
importance
of
self
image
and
respect
in
the
streets
.
when
i
was
an
8
year
old
girl
my
dad
took
me
hunting
for
the
first
time
,
when
i
shot
the
rifle
he
gave
me
,
i
instantly
fell
in
love
with
the
sport
.
but
it
was
n't
just
the
sport
he
taught
me
about
,
he
also
showed
me
the
huge
responsibility
that
lies
behind
that
trigger
but
most
of
all
he
taught
me
that
something
so
small
like
a
bullet
could
change
your
life
and
someone
else
's
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
,
and
if
you
ever
harm
someone
with
it
...
it
must
come
down
to
fearing
for
your
life
.
what
we
need
in
this
country
is
education
.
we
spend
more
money
in
prisons
then
colleges
and
then
wonder
why
parents
are
not
educating
children
with
values
now
a
days
.
it
is
n't
guns
that
kill
people
,
is
the
mentality
these
people
carry
around
in
their
heads
that
kill
other
people
.
there
is
a
bigger
picture
then
what
we
are
seeing
here
,
and
a
bigger
monster
to
tackle
.
if
someone
wants
to
kill
,
they
will
kill
,
gun
or
no
gun
.
banning
guns
is
not
the
solution
.
education
is
.
<new_line>
no
,
because
it
is
a
second
amendment
right
to
allow
citizens
to
keep
firearms
.
to
control
the
sale
of
them
is
one
thing
,
to
ban
them
entirely
is
unconstitutional
and
a
over
reaction
.
look
at
all
the
car
accidents
that
result
from
reckless
drivers
.
should
we
ban
the
cars
to
prevent
such
accidents
.
no
.
such
a
overreaction
is
like
burning
down
a
house
trying
to
roast
a
pig
.
<new_line>
the
second
amendment
is
made
for
a
militia
that
would
work
to
protect
the
communities
.
if
the
fathers
of
the
nation
would
know
what
they
have
done
they
would
decide
do
not
create
the
"
free
"
america
.
there
is
no
freedom
that
have
been
made
to
kill
people
and
destroy
the
life
.
the
fathers
of
the
american
democracy
developed
the
freedoms
to
make
a
country
of
individuals
with
high
spirit
and
good
will
.
is
it
good
will
to
keep
tens
of
guns
at
home
to
protect
from
everybody
-
that
thinking
is
much
closer
to
a
thinking
of
a
psicho
than
to
a
thinking
of
a
normal
men
.
there
are
organizations
that
make
a
lot
of
money
making
american
psichos
.
the
true
is
that
even
if
you
had
your
two
or
three
guns
in
a
massacres
you
would
nt
be
able
to
use
any
of
those
without
to
take
a
good
part
of
the
mass
killing
.
when
in
such
case
the
police
arrive
you
will
be
more
likely
to
be
killed
as
offendor
that
to
be
greeted
as
a
protector
.
and
what
is
the
result
at
the
end
-
just
a
scene
of
a
stupid
bloody
holliwood
movie
.
the
true
is
that
the
only
way
to
make
america
safer
is
to
remove
the
guns
completely
from
the
american
home
and
american
streets
.
if
owing
a
gun
will
be
a
criminal
act
all
those
gangs
will
be
put
in
prisons
for
less
than
a
week
.
the
mad
guys
with
mad
plans
will
be
put
in
the
hospitals
for
a
week
.
and
the
country
will
become
safe
and
nice
place
where
you
can
walk
even
after
9
pm
.
look
at
the
countires
in
the
world
.
is
america
the
safest
one
or
not
and
why
.
having
senators
aand
rep
.
's
talking
that
the
gun
would
protect
a
teacher
in
a
school
or
a
child
-
is
n't
it
a
sign
of
madness
.
those
guys
for
sure
should
nt
be
let
having
guns
.
if
they
are
so
mad
how
mad
would
be
their
kids
.
if
there
is
a
fine
if
you
let
a
kid
to
smoke
or
drink
before
the
age
of
18
or
21
is
n't
it
stupid
to
allow
the
same
kid
to
learn
to
shoot
with
guns
on
aim
.
and
of
course
the
question
comes
-
did
god
say
-
not
kill
(
there
was
nothink
like
-
not
drink
or
not
smoke
)
.
or
the
gun
lobists
think
that
the
god
will
work
for
their
lobbies
too
.
is
not
a
shame
or
fun
for
sure
-
it
is
a
stupidity
and
fearlessness
from
the
true
but
the
punishment
comes
till
the
live
time
.
the
god
is
good
but
does
n't
forget
.
so
weird
was
to
hear
religious
people
stating
that
the
guns
are
not
the
issue
.
they
for
sure
are
the
issue
.
the
issue
are
the
man
and
women
that
believe
only
in
their
guns
and
do
n't
know
how
mental
sick
they
are
.
<new_line>
you
live
in
holliwood
movie
i
see
.
but
after
the
movie
the
actors
are
alive
.
in
the
real
world
if
you
have
rambo
everywhere
you
will
have
killed
people
everywhere
and
guess
who
will
be
killed
-
good
or
bad
.
wake
up
or
drink
your
drugs
on
time
.
<new_line>
cars
are
n't
weapons
.
anything
can
be
used
as
a
weapon
but
that
does
n't
make
it
a
weapon
(
meaning
it
's
primary
purpose
is
to
kill
someone
)
.
<new_line>
thing
is
,
full
on
gun
bans
do
n't
work
.
not
if
you
already
have
really
lax
gun
laws
to
begin
with
.
not
even
restrictions
would
work
in
our
society
.
you
see
,
millions
,
if
not
,
probably
trillions
of
firearms
and
related
items
have
been
diffused
across
the
united
states
over
the
past
sixty
years
.
like
all
material
items
,
a
lot
of
these
guns
,
and
i
mean
a
lot
,
have
been
traded
,
sold
,
bought
again
,
or
locked
away
in
storage
and
forgotten
.
a
lot
of
them
at
gun
shows
,
where
one
can
purchase
a
new
or
used
firearm
without
having
to
register
it
.
even
if
the
government
were
to
go
down
the
list
,
name
by
name
,
of
everyone
who
's
registered
a
firearm
,
at
least
95
%
of
those
names
would
be
outdated
,
as
the
owner
had
sold
it
a
long
time
ago
.
my
next
point
is
that
we
would
be
defenseless
.
look
at
australia
,
for
instance
.
one
small
shooting
and
-boom!-
no
more
guns
.
of
course
,
guns
are
not
fully
banned
,
but
are
really
hard
to
acquire
.
that
being
said
,
when
the
government
asked
for
all
the
guns
back
,
the
good
,
law
-
abiding
people
coughed
them
up
,
while
the
criminals
kept
them
.
this
resulted
in
an
increased
crime
rate
.
the
baddies
had
nothing
to
fear
,
because
the
odds
that
their
targets
had
a
weapon
was
slim
to
none
.
lastly
,
even
if
you
banned
guns
,
and
everyone
-even
the
criminals-
handed
them
in
like
good
little
minions
,
the
criminals
could
very
easily
just
acquire
them
illegally
;
that
,
or
come
after
you
with
a
hatchet
or
machete
.
honestly
,
if
i
had
a
choice
,
i
'd
rather
be
popped
once
in
the
head
with
a
.45
than
be
hacked
to
death
,
piece
by
piece
,
while
i
'm
still
breathing
.
would
n't
you
?
<new_line>
there
is
no
way
to
be
sure
that
people
will
not
use
guns
to
harm
or
kill
innocent
people
,
like
in
the
2006
pennsylvanian
amish
school
shooting
.
guns
offer
too
much
power
that
some
people
will
not
use
carefully
and
kill
gratuitously
.
<new_line>
yes
but
if
the
principles
or
any
of
the
teachers
of
school
shootings
that
have
happened
over
the
years
the
principles
/
teachers
would
have
been
able
to
shoot
the
man
and
might
have
even
stopped
the
man
from
even
shooting
anyone
.
<new_line>
enforce
the
laws
we
already
have
,
more
than
10,000
people
die
from
drunk
driving
and
most
of
them
are
from
second
and
third
offenders
because
some
peice
of
shit
money
hungry
lawer
got
them
off
.
the
asshole
who
killed
those
two
fireman
only
did
18
years
in
jail
for
killing
his
grand
mother
with
a
hammer
,
he
killed
a
human
being
with
a
freaking
hammer
for
god
sake
and
some
lawer
got
him
to
only
serve
18
years
,
put
that
lawers
name
on
the
internet
along
with
the
judge
who
let
him
out
.
come
to
my
house
and
try
and
take
my
guns
i
actually
leave
my
doors
unlocked
hoping
some
porolled
ass
hole
breaks
in
.
if
more
people
carried
guns
assholes
would
have
to
think
twice
about
commiting
a
crime
<new_line>
any
gun
control
is
unconstitutional
.
so
no
,
guns
should
not
be
banned
nor
should
any
type
of
ban
be
in
place
.
2nd
amendment
:
a
well
regulated
militia
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
,
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
.
any
law
to
limit
type
of
gun
used
,
owned
,
or
banned
guns
,
ammo
,
magazine
size
,
etc
.
is
by
definition
infringement
of
the
2nd
amendment
because
the
government
is
telling
its
people
what
s
ok
and
not
ok
.
where
in
any
of
that
ideology
of
gun
control
laws
does
that
spell
freedom
?
once
the
infringement
begins
with
the
2nd
amendment
where
will
it
stop
?
government
says
movies
and
video
games
are
to
violent
and
ban
them
.
big
macs
,
soda
,
and
fries
make
you
to
fat
so
we
'll
ban
those
.
gun
laws
and
bans
are
put
in
place
that
only
affect
good
law
abiding
free
citizens
.
criminals
do
not
follow
laws
.
that
is
by
definition
a
criminal
!
!
!
they
will
steal
guns
,
get
them
from
the
black
market
,
or
from
any
illegal
shipments
from
other
countries
if
they
have
to
.
most
of
these
mass
shootings
happen
in
so
called
"
gun
free
zones
"
.
where
gun
control
laws
prohibit
good
law
abiding
citizens
from
carrying
a
gun
to
protect
themselves
and
others
.
these
gun
free
zones
like
schools
,
hospitals
,
post
offices
,
most
government
areas
,
as
well
as
buisnesses
and
public
conventions
that
post
no
gun
allowed
signs
,
are
basically
advertising
to
these
criminals
,
psychos
,
and
mass
murders
that
this
will
be
a
easy
place
to
slaughter
people
because
no
one
can
defend
themselves
!
!
!
how
often
do
you
hear
of
a
mass
shooting
or
gun
related
firefight
at
a
place
where
there
are
known
100
's
of
gun
carriers
like
gun
shows
,
police
stations
,
or
nra
conventions
?
because
criminals
know
some
people
will
be
packing
a
gun
there
and
it
will
not
be
easy
.
there
are
thousands
of
stories
where
armed
citizens
stop
criminals
,
in
many
cases
without
firing
a
shot
and
just
showing
the
gun
.
the
liberal
media
today
mostly
just
films
the
major
gun
massacres
and
shootings
because
its
big
news
,
gets
peoples
attention
,
ratings
,
and
promotes
their
agenda
for
gun
control
.
<new_line>
true
,
people
kill
people
,
no
guns
,
but
guns
allow
a
person
to
kill
many
people
in
a
short
time
.
if
that
nut
did
n't
have
a
gun
,
how
kids
do
you
think
hw
wouldv'e
been
able
to
kill
with
a
knife
or
club
before
being
subdued
?
a
gun
gives
that
person
the
feeling
like
he
is
invincible
,
which
makes
it
easier
for
him
to
go
on
a
killing
spree
.
if
he
was
n't
able
to
get
a
gun
,
all
those
kids
would
be
alive
today
,
except
maybe
one
.
if
gun
owners
would
think
of
that
,
instead
of
there
own
selfish
desires
to
have
a
gun
,
alot
of
children
would
still
be
alive
today
.
reports
show
that
a
small
percentage
of
gun
owners
actually
use
a
gun
to
defend
themselves
,
there
are
more
killed
with
a
gun
,
than
those
using
a
gun
to
protect
themselves
,
they
cain't
say
it
's
used
for
selfdefense
.
with
all
the
guns
in
the
hands
of
so
called
law
abiding
citizens
,
why
are
so
many
children
massacred
today
?
where
are
they
using
there
guns
to
protect
?
gun
owners
do
n't
want
to
give
up
there
guns
because
of
there
selfish
desire
to
own
one
.
they
want
to
say
"
what
about
my
rights
"
,
what
s
more
important
,
there
desire
to
own
something
they
will
rarely
use
,
or
those
childrens
rights
that
was
killed
to
grow
up
?
they
do
n't
need
it
for
food
,
that
s
what
stores
are
for
.
i
guess
they
just
like
to
shoot
helpless
beings
to
see
blood
,
what
a
minute
,
that
sounds
like
that
nut
who
shot
all
those
kids
!
maybe
we
really
do
need
to
outlaw
guns
.
<new_line>
who
said
shotguns
is
n't
a
deadly
tool
?
you
ever
see
what
damage
it
does
to
a
body
?
that
s
why
the
army
uses
them
!
!
!
!

<new_line>
true
,
if
you
want
to
hunt
,
get
a
bow
,
its
more
sporting
anyway
.
what
s
the
sport
in
shooting
a
deer
300
yards
away
?
<new_line>
if
being
american
is
going
aroubd
schools
and
shooting
little
kids
because
its
american
,
maybe
i
need
to
leave
.
<new_line>
i
do
nt
agree
,
it
does
nt
matter
what
kind
of
gun
it
was
.
if
auto
guns
did
nt
exist
...
it
still
woulda
heppened
.....
if
no
guns
existed
at
all
.....
it
still
woulda
happened
......
same
amount
of
people
...
same
outcome
...
wich
is
people
dead
..
i
do
think
they
would
of
still
killed
20
kids
and
6
teachers
if
that
was
his
intention
......
never
said
anything
about
slapping
either
...
i
said
that
he
would
train
and
train
...
idc
if
it
took
10
years
.....
he
would
ve
made
it
a
point
...
to
make
what
he
wanted
to
happen
...
happen
..
he
would
plan
it
to
the
t
...
and
make
sure
that
they
died
..
if
that
s
what
he
wanted
...
one
way
or
another
..
without
a
gun
or
knife
...
if
that
s
what
he
wanted
...
that
s
how
crazy
people
work
.
i
do
nt
agree
.....
if
those
people
(
crazy
people
)
had
a
sledgehammer
(
a
gun
)
i
do
not
think
that
they
would
drive
the
coffin
(
kill
people
)
in
the
ground
faster
than
if
they
had
a
regular
hammer
...
(
their
own
fists
and
feet
)
......
because
.....
those
people
who
are
crazy
enough
to
do
that
,
are
also
crazy
enough
to
make
sure
it
happens
..
and
put
plan
,
and
effort
into
it
...
they
would
learn
martial
arts
,
(
the
kind
that
can
kill
people
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
(
the
same
speed
as
a
bullet
)
)
...
our
human
body
is
just
as
dangerous
as
a
gun
...
and
those
crazy
ass
people
would
put
so
much
training
and
planning
into
their
actions
that
the
same
result
would
happen
.
(
my
opinion
(
as
this
is
a
debate
)
)
.
<new_line>
communist
these
days
are
just
a
label
on
top
of
a
country
that
has
government
placing
crazy
amount
of
restrictions
to
shape
a
society
into
something
.
but
yes
,
i
still
say
that
word
because
it
is
absurd
to
tax
civilian
50
%
plus
on
the
middle
class
income
.
go
figure
!
<new_line>
i
think
guns
should
be
allowed
in
schools
only
if
the
teacher
or
principal
has
at
least
two
years
of
experience
on
how
a
gun
works
and
how
to
shoot
a
gun
and
also
for
protection
of
the
students

good
poetry
but
outlaws
are
not
the
only
problem
.
you
haven´t
tought
about
massacres
in
schools
,
have
you
?
these
pupils
shooting
around
would
definitly
thing
about
what
they
´
re
actually
doing
if
it
would´t
be
this
easy
to
get
guns.this
would
prevent
many
children
from
dying
!
<new_line>
while
i
think
it
would
be
too
soon
to
"
ban
guns
in
america
"
outright
..
i
firmly
believe
we
need
to
ask
ourselves
is
a
gun
in
everyone
's
hand
really
the
world
we
want
to
live
in
?
guns
need
not
be
banned
right
away
..
but
i
do
believe
our
goal
should
be
cultivating
a
world
where
we
do
n't
need
guns
.
that
's
our
goal
.
that
is
different
from
what
is
really
taking
place
but
that
is
our
goal
.
life
and
the
preservation
of
life
is
the
most
important
thing
.
our
mission
should
be
to
preserve
life
.
there
is
an
unrealistic
feeling
of
"
control
"
that
a
gun
gives
you
.
basically
blinding
people
to
think
that
somehow
they
can
be
above
the
natural
godly
chaos
of
the
world
.
if
someone
really
wants
to
kill
you
,
there
's
not
much
of
a
chance
of
you
defending
yourself
.
if
you
believe
in
a
higher
power
there
is
no
reason
to
be
scared
.
if
it
the
spirit
within
us
all
is
collective
than
you
really
do
n't
have
anything
to
fear
but
fear
itself
.
as
far
as
one
post
stating
if
we
all
had
money
and
the
basic
essentials
than
there
would
be
no
reason
for
guns
...
i
think
this
sentiment
is
spot
on
.
nobody
ever
discusses
the
real
reason
criminals
have
guns
.
there
are
too
many
to
name
,
but
they
all
usually
go
back
to
an
unhealthy
relationship
to
money
and
greed
in
our
society
,
the
paper
chase
.
i
'm
not
saying
we
need
to
be
communists
.
even
ancient
rome
fed
it
's
peasants
in
the
street
.
there
is
a
civic
as
well
as
a
spiritual
responsibility
we
have
towards
mankind
.
we
are
all
on
the
same
side
here
.
our
individual
salvation
depends
on
our
collective
salvation
.
you
ca
n't
keep
killing
the
problem
.
you
must
educate
and
preserve
life
.
on
a
small
scale
guns
could
be
replaced
with
tasers
and
other
close
range
defense
mechanisms
.
guns
initial
purpose
was
to
defend
against
the
tyranny
of
government
by
forming
militia
.
which
i
would
argue
a
gun
or
semi
automatic
wo
n't
do
much
against
our
current
military
.
the
2nd
amendment
is
dated
to
say
the
least
.
it
was
meant
for
defending
against
indians
and
the
british
.
i
'm
pretty
sure
the
peaceful
education
of
our
enemies
and
ourselves
has
turned
these
foes
into
our
brothers
.
the
world
is
more
educated
than
ever
...
and
there
are
social
networking
sites
and
the
internet
which
can
disseminate
information
faster
than
ever
.
we
can
either
be
part
of
a
global
arms
race
and
kill
ourselves
or
we
can
seek
virtue
,
truth
,
and
education
in
order
to
live
in
harmony
.
i
will
add
that
guns
are
n't
really
the
issue
at
hand
.
it
's
a
disconnection
to
our
spirituality
.
and
not
a
religious
spirituality
,
a
mankind
spirituality
that
connects
us
all
.
if
we
really
loved
all
life
(
not
liked
)
but
loved
life
we
would
be
in
favor
of
preserving
it
and
educating
the
world
to
preserve
it
.
guns
are
just
a
reminder
of
our
mortal
beings
and
immortal
souls
.
<new_line>
i
think
that
guns
are
not
bad
but
if
they
are
used
in
a
bad
way
then
they
can
do
realharm
.
this
is
why
people
are
dying
because
people
are
using
the
guns
in
wrong
ways
which
will
mean
to
veryy
sad
consiquences
.
<new_line>
guns
should
be
not
banned
but
i
think
they
should
be
a
bit
more
restricted
with
more
secured
information
on
buyer
of
the
gun
.
<new_line>
yes
,
there
should
be
guns
in
america
because
americe
right
now
is
turning
into
comunism
and
we
need
to
fight
back
!
if
the
guns
were
banned
we
would
be
in
comunism
or
scared
because
the
president
has
all
the
guns
and
he
could
kill
us
!
obama
is
a
comunist
and
we
need
to
fight
back
!
<new_line>
are
you
crazy
?
!
ban
cars
really
?
how
are
we
going
to
get
around
in
this
bloody
place
then
lad
?
how
?
that
is
dumbest
idea
ever
!
<new_line>
who
ever
voted
up
is
the
stupedist
person
ever
and
you
are
a
democrat
or
as
i
like
to
call
it
comunism
!
<new_line>
what
sucks
is
both
sides
have
some
valid
points
but
one
side
is
going
about
it
all
wrong
.
limiting
guns
or
their
capacities
to
hold
ammunition
will
not
stop
the
violence
it
will
only
change
the
tools
used
but
probably
not
even
that
as
we
see
in
examples
.
what
s
worse
than
guns
in
this
country
is
our
technicalities
.
all
a
technicality
should
do
is
save
someone
from
being
put
to
death
.
there
should
be
no
instances
where
we
consider
someones
background
for
a
crime
committed
and
its
sentence
.
but
then
again
there
are
so
many
things
considered
a
crime
in
this
country
any
more
just
to
generate
capital
that
everything
needs
to
be
considered
before
a
change
like
that
can
happen
.
we
've
complicated
things
so
much
because
we
allow
feelings
get
in
the
way
of
the
real
agenda
.
protection
is
a
basic
right
from
anyone
and
from
anything
,
murder
is
not
and
until
that
is
addressed
,
all
these
what
-
if
scenarios
to
create
an
agenda
are
wrong
.
yes
they
occur
and
must
be
addressed
but
it
should
not
be
mixed
into
another
agenda
.
the
gun
owners
using
any
verbal
ammunition
no
pun
intended
to
protect
their
rights
as
you
have
seen
are
only
retaliating
to
all
these
what
-
if
scenarios
you
create
to
infringe
on
their
rights
,
which
is
also
your
right
if
you
choose
to
accept
it
.
these
men
and
women
have
not
done
anything
wrong
for
you
to
attack
them
and
are
only
defending
themselves
from
an
attack
.
the
second
amendment
was
put
into
law
by
the
law
for
they
knew
the
travesties
that
could
happen
when
law
corrupts
.
we
as
individuals
know
how
the
country
'
should
'
work
but
we
do
not
see
all
the
gears
turning
and
changing
and
many
times
these
gedon'tdont
get
oiled
or
over
oiled
and
we
must
keep
our
basic
rights
unscathed
or
we
will
then
be
scathed
.
i
understand
we
are
complex
beings
but
if
we
keep
over
complicating
certain
things
the
real
problems
will
never
get
addressed
.
so
to
all
you
homos
who
write
all
these
long
drawn
out
stories
thinking
because
of
it
your
agenda
has
won
because
of
it
.
eat
this
.
mines
bigger
than
most
of
yours
and
i
m
not
talking
about
my

haha
and
i
'm

for
all
you
wise
a$$es
haha
.
<new_line>
the
number
1
weapon
used
in
a
violent
crime
is
a
baseball
bat
...
not
a
gun
.
plus
,
when
your
endangered
,
the
police
are
minutes
away
when
only
seconds
count
to
save
your
life
.
guns
should
not
be
banned
because
then
the
government
would
become
to
powerful
.
if
it
is
a
right
,
then
that
should
n't
be
able
to
be
taken
away
from
you
.
they
should
take
baseball
bats
away
before
guns
because

,
they

kill
people
so
it
would
n’t
matter
a
lot
if
everyone
could
get
one
.
•
people
will
not
be
able
to
hunt
for
recreation
.
<new_line>
•
it
will
reduce
murders
and
shootings
.
•
people
will
not
be
able
to
feel
safe
if
everyone
can
have
a
gun
.
•
children
will
be
given
a
bad
example
when
they
see
parents
that
have
guns
.
•
statistics
show
that
canada
,
uk
,
and
australia
have
lower
rates
of
gangs
.
this
is
because
they
ban
guns
.
•
mentally
ill
people
might
accidently
use
it
if
they
get
hallucinations
or
think
they
are
in
danger
,
even
if
they
are
perfectly
safe
.
•
the
government
ca
n’t
have
any
gun
control
.
•
gun
violence
is
making
us
lose
billions
of
dollars
.
•
it
causes
obstacles
to
economic
growth
.
•
we
ca
n’t
let
a
shooting
like
the
connecticut
shooting
happen
again

i
would
love
to
live
in
a
world
where
we
did
nt
need
nuclear
weapons
.
unfortunately
,
we
do
.
yes
,
most
of
europe
wants
to
give
them
up
,
but
what
aboout
north
korea
?
what
about
iran
?
if
those
2
countries
ever
got
one
and
one
that
worked
.
iran
is
trying
to
make
one
,
do
nt
believe
all
that
uranium
is
just
for
nuclear
power
.
ahmideinejhad
himself
said
once
he
has
nuclear
capabilities
,
he
would
use
them
.
n
korea
tried
launching
some
of
their
own
.
thank
god
they
did
nt
work
.
as
long
as
there
are
people
out
there
willing
to
use
them
,
everyone
who
has
them
should
keep
them
in
standby
.
the
only
defense
for
a
nuclear
attack
is
to
send
up
our
own
nukes
to
intercept
them
,
and
we
can
.
<new_line>
if
i
could
avoid
it
yes
.
but
i
'd
hurt
ur
feelings
with
words
any
day
..

<new_line>
ah
great
a

it

<new_line>
guns
do
nt
kill
people
!
i
am
against
assualt
gun
bans
!
not
only
are
these
toy
fun
and
look
good
,
they
are
a
simble
of
american
freedom
.
however
gun
education
and
gun
safty
are
important
.
for
example
,
teach
a
child
not
to
play
with
guns
and
that
they
can
and
will
kill
people
.
assualt
guns
are
already
tough
to
come
by
,
this
would
only
effect
law
abiding
citizens
!
it
would
also
mean
people
who
illeagaly
buy
guns
can
so
easily
kill
us
without
guns
.
so
if
you
ban
guns
even
more
poeple
might
die
to
them
.
with
a
gun
in
your
hand
for
defence
you
can
kill
the
person
tring
to
kill
you
.
beter
them
then
you
right
?
<new_line>
"
i
ask
,
sir
,
what
is
the
millitia
?
it
is
the
whole

,
to
disarm
the
people
is
the
best
and
most
effective
way
to
enslave
them
.

guns
do
n't
kill

.
people
kill
people
.
its
not
everyone
's
right
to
have
a
gun
but
that
does
n't
mean
they
should
be
banned
.
we
just
need
a
true
sense
of
self
control
and
some
more
protection
against
guns
by
simply
giving
out
bullet
proof
vest
as
some
sort
of
promotion
or
public
service
.
<new_line>
yean
,
and
chicago
and
dc
works
well
for
you
.
even
if
you
ban
everything
in
this
country
,
you
have
people
that
fabricate
their
own
firearms
including
importing
it
over
from
mexico
,
legally
and
illegally
.
wake
up
.
you
have
been
living
in
a
box
.
<new_line>
car
is
easier
to
run
things
over
.
much
easier
than
throwing
stone
,
rocks
,
or
logs
.
every
single
existing
thing
in
this
world
is
a
double
sided
blade
.
the
more
powerful
,
the
more
you
have
to
be
cautious
to
use
it
.
guns
were
used
to
protect
innocent
9
times
out
of
10
.
should
we
let
9
innocent
people
gamble
their
lives
without
gun
just
so
we
can
lie
to
ourselves
that
another
1
out
of
10
would
be
safe
.
since
criminals
find
black
market
and
do
n't
obey
law
.
what
's
the
point
.
saying
banning
guns
would
make
our
society
safer
is
completely
delusional
.
it
's
like
speaking
without
logic
but
pure
emotion
.
<new_line>
would
you
post
a
sign
in
front
of
your
house
saying
"
i
do
n't
believe
in
guns
.
i
do
n't
have
a
gun
,
neither
should
you
.
"
<new_line>
it
's
not
for

,
it
's
for
defending

you
can
move

<new_line>
no
guns
do
n't
kill
people
,
people
kill
people
and
saying
gun
kill
people
is
saying
that
people
do
n't
toast
,
toast
but
that
toast
,
toast
,
toast
once
after
this
debate
went
major
i
set
out
a
gun
with
it
loaded
setting
it
in
a
lawn
chair
right
beside
me
in
my
front
yard
and
numerous
people
went
by
like
the
mailman
guys
on
motorcycles
and
little
girls
playing
and
despite
all
the
chances
the
gun
had
to
shot
someone
about
one
thousand
times
that
day
and
it
never
happened
but
then
i
went
hunting
found
a
nice
deer
and
then
i
yes
i
shot
the
deer
and
it
died
by
who
me
have
you
ever
noticed
that
guns
never
get
credit
for
killing
but
the
person
does
?
that
's
because
the
person
kills
the
person
shots
not
the
gun
unless
there
like
the
toy
story
characters
and
walk
around
when
i
'm
not
looking
which
i
highly
doubt
so
people
kill
people
and
people
toasts
toast
<new_line>
guns
do
n't
kill
people
.
there
should
be
perhaps
more
restrictions
or
background
checks
(
for
people
with
mental
disorders
,
etc
.
)
but
the
only
people
that
would
be
affected
by
banning
guns
would
be
the
lawful
citizens
.
if
you
make
it
illegal
to
rob
a
bank
,
the
criminals
would
continue
robbing
banks
even
if
it
was
illegal
.
criminals
would
still
use
guns
.
they
do
n't
care
what
the
law
is
.
responsible
gun
owners
(
like
myself
)
use
them
for
lawful
reasons
.
mainly
i
have
guns
for
hunting
,
riflery
,
etc
.
not
even
with
an
emphasis
on
personal
protection
,
however
not
against
it
.
<new_line>
they
are
not
a
waste
.
i
use
them
for
hunting
,
an
important
pastime
not
only
for
food
but
for
growing
closer
with
my
family
for
which
it
is
a
tradition
.
also
for
personal
protection
,
and
marksmanship
,
a
worthwhile
hobby
.
<new_line>
disarmed
people
=
are
dominated
people
simple
as
that
so
do
we
really
want
to
ban
guns
?
<new_line>
the
reason
some
extreme
islamic
people
hate
america
is
because
they
see
us
as
the
center
of
the
atheistic
western
world
.
they
would
hate
us
whether
we
kill
them
or
not
.
<new_line>
well
then
would
n’t
the
best
solution
be
to
educate
people
rather
than
punish
everyone
?
<new_line>
with
bigger
,
more
important
issues
than
gun
control
looming
around
,
i
think
gun
control
can
wait
.
plus
,
it
is
n't
exactly
a
nat'l
security
threat
,
considering
the
current
population
,
roughly
314
million
strong
,
and
birth
rates
in
the
us
,
30k
lives
to
gun
related
homicide
a
year
is
a
small
price
to
pay
.
you
'd
think
,
with
the
gun
control
side
composed
of
lawyers
with
remarkable
skill
,
they
'd
know
better
than
to
badger
people
with
emotional
pleas
like
their
favorite
argument
,
think
of
the
children
.
these
incidents
are
famous
because
they
happen
so
rarely
.
my
niece
and
nephew
go
out
in
public
all
the
time
and
the
come
home
in
one
piece
99.99
%
of
the
time
.
all
i
have
to
say
to
the
parents
of
the
newtown
victims
is
i
'm
sorry
this
happened
to
you
,
it
is
simply
tragic
,
but
dwelling
on
it
wo
n't
make
the
pain
go
away
,
surely
you
understand
that
life
is
unfair
and
uncertain
,
i
mean
,
you
're
all
older
and
wiser
than
i
am
,
right
?
<new_line>
yes
,
i
believe
this
to
be
a
valid
argument
.
i
personally
support
you
argument
completely
;
especially
the
license
.
to
those
who
say
that
guns
should
be
banned
completely
,
there
are
those
uses
of
guns
which
should
be
allowed
,
for
example
,
hunting
animals
?
<new_line>
guns
can
have
other
uses
,
such
as
hunting
.
also
banning
guns
wo
n't
stop
criminals
getting
guns
.
guns
can
be
smuggled
to
criminals
illegally
.
<new_line>
i
personally
think
guns
should
be
allowed
,
but
with
a
license
.
there
are
other
uses
for
guns
,
such
as
hunting
animals
.
also
banning
guns
wo
n't
stop
gun
crimes
,
as
they
can
be
simply
gained
illegally
,
such
as
smuggling
.
<new_line>
it
is
only
reasonable
to
ban
specific
guns
like
bazookas
or
really
any
thing
found
in
the
military
.
<new_line>
i
would
agree
with
you
if
you
can
100
%
control
all
the
guns
out
of
criminals
hand
,
including
us
government
.
if
you
think
the
government
is
awesome
and
do
everything
right
for
you
and
to
you
,
then
you
are
blind
110
%
of
the
time
,
all
the
time
,
everytime

says
who
?
says
me

<new_line>
therefore
we
should
have
those
rifles
and
ready
for
gorilla
warfare
.
that
's
how
afghanis
'
win
the
war
.
but
,
i
know
for
sure
that
us
government
wo
n't
let
it
get
to
that
point
.
1
,
military
personal
will
side
with
constitution
,
at
least
80
%
of
them
.
2
,
government
wo
n't
do
anything
stupid
that
wo
n't
really
get
money
from
our
tax
dollar
.
therefore
,
they
wo
n't
wage
war
with
citizens
.
however
,
you
do
need
those
rifles
to
keep
the
government
in
check
for
your
own
safety
.
<new_line>
therefore
,
we
should
be
like
swiss
,
1
year
of
reserve
service
.
government
provided
ammo
every
year
to
practice
.
citizens
are
allowed
to
purchase
the
rifle
and
learn
how
to
use
it
.
<new_line>
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
thanks
for
the
great
laugh
.
our
second
amendment
was
given
to
us
so
we
the
people
can
uprise
against
the
government
if
needed
.
the
criminals
will
always
be
there
to
break
the
law
and
will
find
guns
illegally
.
if
you
have
your
home
broken
into
and
you
have
no
gun
then
you
better
hope
you
can
run
faster
then
the
bullet
they
will
have
following
you
.
<new_line>
you
my
friend
are
and
idiot
.
if
i
hand
a
gun
to
a
mentally
fit
person
who
knows
how
to
handle
the
gun
then
they
shall
be
fine
and
will
not
kill
someone
.
hand
the
same
gun
to
a
person
who
has
a
mental
issue
and
also
can
handle
that
gun
you
have
a
murder
on
your
hands
.
banning
the
gun
will
not
help
the
unstable
person
they
will
use
some
other
weapon
to
commit
the
crimes
their
brain
tells
them
to
.
help
the
unstable
person
and
then
no
murder
.
<new_line>
ummm
you
appear
to
view
the
other
side
.
maybe
you
should
figure
out
which
side
you
are
on
first
.
but
your
point
is
perfect
.
i
am
going
to
guess
you
own
a
gun
.
<new_line>
what
do
we
do
if
we
're
mad
in
america
then
?
this
restricts
our
flow
of
emotions
.
<new_line>
i
'm
gon
na
have
to
disagree
with
you
there
.
no
matter
how
hard
a
martial
artist
trained
,
i
do
n't
see
how
they
could
be
able
to
kill
people
as
fast
as
a
semi
-
automatic
weapon
.
yes
,
people
would
have
still
been
killed
,
but
that
many
?
i
do
n't
think
so
.
when
i
say
yes
to
the
question
"
should
guns
be
banned
in
america
?
"
,
i
do
n't
believe
that
hunting
guns
would
need
to
be
banned
.
yes
,
they
can
kill
people
,
but
not
as
fast
as
a
semi
-
automatic
,
giving
more
time
for
the
criminal
to
be
stopped
.
i
do
not
see
the
need
for
semi
-
automatic
weapons
to
be
purchased
by
anyone
.
when
you
go
hunting
,
i
doubt
you
assault
the
deer
.
i
do
agree
with
you
on
what
you
said
about
how
crazy
people
will
go
far
to
make
their
point
,
but
i
still
believe
that
semi
-
automatics
should
be
banned
.
that
is
just
my
opinion
.
<new_line>
yah
duh
,
he
just
said
he
uses
it
lololol
though
i
also
think
it
's
a
good
point
.
<new_line>
with
guns
there
is
less
crime
,
with
no
guns
crime
will
go
up
by
99
%
<new_line>
guns
most
certainly
should
be
banned
in
america
.
as
a
canadian
,
i
know
this
argument
better
than
any
american
alive
today
.
whilst
true
that
guns
do
not
kill
people
,
they
provide
those
with
the
ability
to
kill
.
look
at
all
of
those
school
murders
.
the
theatre
murders
.
need
i
go
on
?
had
those
who
committed
the
murders
been
denied
access
to
such
weapons
,
those
children
would
still
be
alive
today
.
to
allow
others
the
ability
to
own
guns
puts
our
children
in
danger
.
<new_line>
an
absolutely
ridiculous
viewpoint
.
those
who
commit
such
crimes
have
access
to
guns
.
remove
such
access
and
you
have
no
crime
.
one
need
only
create
a
stronger
police
force
,
with
tougher
laws
to
back
them
up
.
the
liberals
have
so
weakened
our
laws
against
criminals
that
it
is
absurd
.
capital
punishment
should
be
brought
back
and
in
greater
force
.
armed
gangs
should
be
wiped
out
via
the
use
of
your
military
.
if
you
have
a
military
,
use
it
.

<new_line>
the
police
are
handcuffed
by
liberal
laws
which
deny
them
the
ability
to
properly
do
their
job
.
these
days
,
criminals
have
more
rights
than
law
-
abiding
citizens
.
blame
your
society
,
not
the
police
.
the
threat
of
death
must
be
held
over
the
head
of
every
criminal
who
seeks
to
kill
by
arms
.
ever
wonder
why
there
was
no
crime
in
the
former
soviet
union
?
<new_line>
you
can
be
'
enslaved
'
whether
you
have
the
right
to
guns
or
not
.
you
are
going
to
use
your
handgun
,
with
no
training
whatsoever
,
against
highly
-
trained
,
well
-
equipped
soldiers
?
none
too
bright
,
are
you
?
your
state
will
enslave
you
whether
you
like
it
or
not
.
rather
difficult
to
do
in
a
democratic
society
,
i
should
think
.
<new_line>
here
,
in
canada
,
it
has
been
discovered
that
by
far
the
majority
of
guns
used
in
the
commission
of
a
crime
originated
from
the
usa
.
criminals
smuggled
them
across
the
border
into
canada
.
this
proves
gun
control
works
.
we
need
only
tighten
up
our
border
,
and
the
crime
ends
.
simple
.
we
had
only
recently
begun
to
arm
our
border
guards
,
which
is
ridiculous
.
our
border
should
not
only
have
armed
guards
,
but
our
military
should
be
stationed
along
the
border
with
the
usa
to
keep
your
violence
out
of
my
country
.
those
caught
smuggling
arms
into
canada
should
be
shot
on
the
spot
.
no
questions
asked
.
no
trial
.
nothing
.
end
of
.
<new_line>
but
,
do
they
not
ban
drunk
drivers
from
driving
again
?
i
see
you
fail
to
understand
the
point
of
banning
weapons
.
just
as
cars
do
not
kill
people
,
but
their
drivers
do
,
so
do
the
owners
of
handguns
.
it
is
difficult
to
control
those
who
would
own
guns
just
as
it
is
difficult
to
control
those
who
own
cars
.
we
can
not
ban
cars
,
but
,
we
can
ban
those
who
have
proven
to
be
difficult
the
right
to
drive
them
.
as
weapons
are
not
cars
,
but
objects
designed
solely
to
kill
,
they
should
be
banned
outright
.
<new_line>
tell
me
,
what
is
the
entire
point
of
having
a
police
force
?
if
you
have
weapons
,
then
why
bother
keeping
a
police
force
?
or
a
military
for
that
matter
?
people
like
you
simple
do
not
get
it
.
<new_line>
the
solution
is
quite
simple
.
go
after
those
arms
dealers
,
and
execute
them
on
the
spot
.
i
can
not
believe
how
simple
this
is
,
yet
no
one
thinks
about
it
.
that
's
liberalism
for
you
.
<new_line>
you
hear
a
footstep
nearby
.
you
are
frightened
.
you
see
someone
.
in
fear
,
you
pull
the
fucking
trigger
,
killing
the
poor
bastard
who
just
happened
to
be
nearby
.
what
did
he
ever
do
to
you
?
you
get
into
an
argument
with
a
friend
of
yours
.
you
become
so
pissed
you
pull
out
your
gun
and
put
a
few
holes
into
his
head
.
ever
hear
of
the
wild
west
,
my
good
man
?
feel
free
to
run
along
.
<new_line>
how
did
said
bad
guy
obtain
a
gun
in
the
first
place
?
no
doubt
they
are
readily
available
thanks
to
your
lax
gun
laws
.
<new_line>
this
is
a
wonderful
example
of
how
crazy
the
anti
gun
people
can
get
.
<new_line>
guns
can
kill
so
many
people
in
just
a
short
amount
of
time
.
<new_line>
this
is
n't
very
new
,
but
it
's
true
.
if
guns
are
outlawed
,
only
outlaws
have
guns
.
i
've
heard
supporters
of
gun
control
peck
at
this
unoriginality
,
claiming
it
to
be
a
weakness
.
the
reason
we
repeat
this
is
because
it
's
true
.
gun
control
needs
to
die
and
the
people
supported
gun
control
should
focus
on
what
makes
criminals
.
also
,
before
you
blame
money
,
it
's
not
money
,
it
's
finding
wants
to
be
more
important
than
things
like
morals
and
others
<new_line>

<new_line>
a

point
in

<new_line>
the

:
a

,
being
necessary
to
the

of
a

,
the
right
of
the

to

,
shall
not
be

.
<new_line>
no
!
!
!
this
great
nation
’s
founding
fathers
adopted
the
2nd
amendment
in
1791
,
which
protects
the
right
of
individuals
to
keep
and
bear
arms
in
america
:
“
a
well

being

,
the

.
”
i
believe
that
once
ultra
liberal
politicians
and
voters
begin
(
actually
they
have
already
begun
)
to
chip
away
and
erode
our
inalienable
constitutional
rights
,
american
as
we
currently
know
it
,
will
quickly
begin
to
implode
within
and
eventually
crumble
.
just
read
history
…
its
happened
repeatedly
since
the
dawn
of
civilization
.
if
the
2nd
amendment
were
to
go
away
,
then
guess
what
,
so
then
will
the
1st
amendment
,
3rd
amendment
,
4
amendment
,
and
so
on
.
starting
to
see
a
pattern
here
america
?
guns
are
just
inanimate
objects
,
no
different
than
a
car
,
a
knife
,
a
hammer
or
a
baseball
bat
(
all
of
which
can
just
as
easily
kill
people
btw
)
.
hmmm
,
so
lets
outlaw
cars
,
knives
,
hammers
and
baseball
bats
too
.
yea
right
.
do
you
see
how
utterly
ridiculous
and
useless
gun
control
is
!
so
you
see
…
guns
do
n’t
kill
people
…
people
kill
people
.
lets
focus
on
fixing
the
root
of
america
's
core
problems
:
the
mental
health
crisis
,
stop
letting
prisoners
out
of
prison
,
stronger
parental
control
over
their
children
playing
violent
video
games
and
tv
,
fixing
our
broken
judicial
system
,
and
the
list
goes
on
and
on
.
besides
…
even
if
all
guns
were
confiscated
by
the
government
,
tens
of
thousands
of
illegal
guns
will
still
be
easily
attainable
via
the
black
market
and
the
cartels
.
<new_line>
if
you
shoot
people
they
can
die
or
get
hurt
very
badly.why
should
people
do
that
and
this
is
why
guns
should
be
banned
from
america
<new_line>
idiots
with
guns
:
yes
.
guns
in
general
:
no
.
if
you
do
n't
keep
your
weapon
secure
around
children
,
or
give
a
machine
gun
to
a
kid
to
fire
at
your
gun
range
(
wtf
?
)
or
are
deemed
mentally
unstable
you
should
be
deemed
unworthy
to
carry
a
deadly
firearm
.
responsible
people
should
own
guns
.
<new_line>
i
have
seen
enough
.
even
if
people
say
that
the
gun
is
just
the
object
and
it
is
the
person
who
sets
the
trigger
,
the
government
is
not
doing
enough
to
look
after
people
who
do
such
mas
murders
.
the
social
system
is
failing
them
and
so
the
only
way
to
protect
society
is
to
ban
guns
completely
.
this
is
a
weapon
that
can
be
used
for
destruction
by
certain
people
.
if
the
system
is
not
able
to
stop
people
getting
ready
access
to
such
weapon
them
then
we
must
stop
giving
them
guns
altogether
.
<new_line>
yes
it
should
.
why
do
people
need
guns
when
leaving
in
such
a
protected
place
.
in
japan
here
,
the
place
is
calming
and
not
attacks
can
be
heard
,
why
not
drop
down
those
guns
and
make
a
world
the
calming
place
.
the
gun
laws
are
outdated
i
myself
am
not
american
,
but
in
my
opinion
guns
should
be
banned
,
or
have
very
strict
laws
placed
on
them
.
i
know
the
other
side
goes
on
about
having
"
a
right
to
bare
arms
"
,
which
is
all
well
and
good
,
but
having
studied
american
history
,
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
main
reason
guns
and
possibly
the
creed
"
a
right
to
bare
arms
"
itself
existed
as
america
was
an
incredibly
lawless
place
at
one
time
,
and
so
people
needed
to
have
their
own
means
of
protection
.
but
we
're
in
the
21st
century
now
,
leave
protection
to
those
who
's
jobs
it
is
to
protect
people
,
people
who
are
well
-
trained
like
police
officers
etc
.
simply
,
america
's
obsession
with
guns
is
little
more
than
paranoia
and
a
fear
of
change
,
and
while
some
individuals
may
offer
compelling
arguments
of
why
the
law
should
stay
,
it
's
undeniable
that
a
majority
are
simply
afraid
of
change
.
<new_line>
the
purpose
of
guns
is
n't
to
kill
people
.
it
's
what
people
do
with
them
,
but
it
's
not
their
purpose
.
just
like
a
kitchen
knife
is
n't
meant
to
cut
things
.
it
's
meant
to
prepare
food
,
as
a
gun
is
meant
for
protection
.
also
,
mass
shootings
are
a
pretty
recent
phenomena
and
are
relatively
rare
in
the
scope
of
gun
violence
.
guns
save
way
more
people
than
they
endanger
,
it
's
just
that
mass
shootings
make
for
juicier
stories
than
self
-
protection
in
a
home
invasion
.
banning
guns
is
essentially
taking
away
our
inalienable
right
to
protect
ourselves
.
criminals
do
n't
follow
the
law
,
so
what
makes
you
think
a
criminal
would
n't
own
a
gun
illegally
in
a
ban
.
the
only
thing
that
happens
is
an
imbalance
of
power
has
been
made
.
certain
people
,
namely
criminals
and
police
,
are
now
more
powerful
than
the
people
in
need
of
protection
.
as
for
"
heavier
"
guns
,
i
think
that
ownership
of
them
comes
with
freedom
.
anyone
has
the
choice
to
own
a
fast
car
,
but
those
kill
more
people
than
guns
do
,
so
why
not
ban
them
?
because
it
's
ridiculous
.
<new_line>
i
am
against
banning
guns
in
america
,
but
this
argument
does
not
make
sense
.
the
purpose
of
a
gun
is
to
fire
a
lethal
projectile
for
the
purposes
of
hunting
or
protection
,
and
the
purpose
of
a
kitchen
knife
is
to
cut
things
for
the
purpose
of
food
preparation
.
 
that
is
very
true
.
you
'll
get
far
more
viewers
from
covering
mass
shootings
than
you
will
covering
a
story
about
how
gun
related
crimes
are
at
a
historic
low
,
and
still
decreasing
.
 
it
does
n't
take
away
our
inalienable
right
to
protect
ourselves
,
it
just
makes
it
harder
.
one
could
still
protect
themselves
without
a
gun
,
though
you
'd
have
to
try
a
lot
harder
.
as
for
criminals
,
the
fact
that
some
people
will
break
a
law
is
generally
not
considered
a
good
reason
to
avoid
having
said
law
all
together
.
<new_line>
i
agree
with
@kk0bbr
's
argument
all
except
for
point
number
two
.
if
there
we
equal
money
,
power
and
respect
,
the
world
would
be
chaos
.
let
's
start
with
if
there
was
equal
money
.
if
there
was
equal
money
,
many
would
not
be
content
as
greed
is
a
large
part
in
human
nature
,
and
the
end
result
would
be
an
even
more
imbalanced
society
as
there
would
not
be
both
rich
and
poor
people
to
balance
the
scale
,
simply
rich
people
and
average
earners
.
next
,
if
there
was
equal
power
.
if
there
was
equal
power
,
the
america
would
be
a
state
of
anarchy
,
resulting
in
uncivilization
and
no
rules
/
laws
for
citizens
to
follow
.
if
people
made
rules
,
they
would
have
more
power
,
resulting
in
a
big
jolt
for
the
economy
and
the
state
of
everyday
activities
.
and
last
,
if
people
had
equal
respect
,
we
would
have
no
-
one
to
aspire
to
be
like
,
no
idol
for
us
to
follow
the
path
of
.
we
would
be
the
same
in
a
way
.
also
,
it
is
impossible
to
keep
everyone
equally
respected
due
to
the
fact
that
people
engage
in
activities
,
which
may
decrease
or
elevate
your
level
of
respect
given
from
others
.
overall
,
i
agree
that
it
would
not
make
a
difference
.

from
the
nyt
:
"
today
the
supreme
court
will
hear
arguments
in
a
politically
charged
challenge
to
the
district
of
columbia
’s
gun
control
laws
.
the
case
poses
a
vital
question
:
can
cities
impose
reasonable
controls
on
guns
to
protect
their
citizens
?
the
court
should
rule
that
they
can
.
"
from
the
bill
of
rights
:
"
a
well
regulated
militia
,
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
,
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
,
shall
not
be
infringed
.
"
from
my
perspective
,
its
pretty
clear
that
guns
in
cities
are
not
tied
to
militia
service
.
therefore
,
reasonable
limits
are
acceptable
.
<new_line>
people
who
think
gun
control
actually
works
have
n't
begun
to
research
the
subject

the
worst
shootings
in
recent
history
have
taken
place
in
so
called
"
gun
free
zones
,
"
like
schools
and
post
offices
.
this
is
because
these
shooters
can
do
their
thing
practically
unabated
.
imagine
the
conditions
that
elicit
death
in
virginia
tech
were
the

when

<new_line>
ah
,
v
was
quoting
thomas
jefferson
.
are
the
people
of
cuba
very
discontent
?
i
'm
not
contradicting
you
,
i
'm
really
wondering
.
i
had
heard
that
this
was
american
propaganda
;
the
"
refugees
"
who
come
here
are
simply
in
search
of
more
money
,
due
to
a
weak
cuban
economy
(
caused
by
american
policies
in
the
first
place
)
.
the
cuban
i
met
said
that
most
people
there
are
pretty
content
with
the
way
their
country
is
run
.
<new_line>
the
video
you
presented
is
very
persuasive
.
guns
serve
the
function
of
keeping
everyone
equal
.
while
it
is
the
case
that
some
people
may
use
guns
for
malicious
ends
,
if
everyone
had
a
gun
,
and
assuming
everyone
wanted
to
preserve
the
peace
,
the
risk
of
gun
related
violence
would
decrease
.
<new_line>
this
is
an
easy
argument
for
all
the
cliches
:
guns
do
n't
kill
people
people
kill
people
,
and
as

bunker

"

you

"

i

they

although
,
the
ones
who
get

nowadays
,
even
though
they
hate
castro
's
regime
,
still
think
in
a
communist
way

they
're
so
used
to
it
,
that
they
do
n't
know
why
they
hate
it
there
in
the
first
place
.
they
just
know
it
sucks
.
<new_line>
this
should
n't
even
be
a
debate
.
<new_line>
the
problem
is
our
culture
.
in
switzerland
,
gun
ownership
is
mandatory
.
their
murder
rate
is
near
zero
,
because
their
culture
does
not
glorify
violence
.
<new_line>
when
governments
no
longer
use
weapons
as
an
effective
tool
,
then
the
people
might
consider
giving
up
such
things
.
but
when
each
and
every
government
uses
guns
to
not
only
assert
their
authority
but
to
also
acquire
more
property
makes
asking
the
people
to
ignore
this
fact
of
life
and
take
a
passive
role
in
their
own
future
...
highly
dubious

authority
comes
in

form
on

that
is

with

hand
;
mad
mutual

how
willing
is
a

when
they
think
the
victim
may
be
armed
?
odd
how
it
is
commonly
overlooked
that
not
one
country
would
exist
without

here
in

the

it

:
a

,
the
right
of
the
people
to

bear

,
shall
not
be

.
basically
,
the
country
needs
an
army
to
be
a
country
,
but
the
founders
had
just
experienced
their
own
country
's
army
at
the
time
(
england
)
being
used
against
them
and
taking
away
their
weapons
en
masse
.
therefore
they
enshrined
the
second
amendment
in
the
bill
of
rights
just
in
case
it
ever
became
necessary
to
overthrown
the
government
they
created
if
it
had
lost
its
way
.
yes

the

ensured
your
ability
to

<new_line>
definition
of
militia
according
to
princeton
's
wordnet
:
civilians
trained
as
soldiers
but
not
part
of
the
regular
army
.
the
first
part
of
the
second
amendment
(
and
the
only
part
you
cite
)
says
"
a
well
regulated
militia
,
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
.
"
this
basically
says
an
army
of
civilians
trained
to
like
soldiers
,
but
not
actual
soldiers
,
is
necessary
for
our
security
.
it
's
true
,
we
should
have
civilians
trained
in
the
art
of
using
weapons
there
for
our
security
,
instead
of
only
relying
on
the
police
force
or
military
our
government
provides
us
with
.
the
second
part
of
the
second
amendment
(
the
part
you
do
n't
cite
)
says
"
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
,
shall
not
be
infringed
.
"
this
part
says
clear
as
day
that
we
as
people
,
have
the
right
to
not
just
keep
our
arms
,
but
to
also
bear
or
use
them
.
this
goes
hand
in
hand
with
the
first
part
because
a
militia
of
citizens
ca
n't
be
armed
without
this
second
part
.
if
you
read
some
quotes
from
the
founding
fathers
,
then
you
can
see
for
yourselves
just
how
they
felt
about
owning
guns
.
"
the
constitution
shall
never
be
construed
to
authorize
congress
to
prevent
the
people
of
the
united
states
,
who
are
peaceable
citizens
,
from
keeping
their
own
arms
.
"
-
samuel
adams
"
the
strongest
reason
for
the
people
to
retain
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
,
as
a
last
resort
,
to
protect
themselves
against
tyranny
in
government
.
"
-thomas
jefferson
"
a
free
people
ought
to
be
armed

"
-

"

free
man
shall
ever

debarred
the
use
of
arms

really
good
quotes
backing
your

<new_line>
eh
,
maybe
it
's
because
it
's
mandatory
?
plus
,
we
have
waaay
more
people
and
have
much
more
access
to
weapons
than
other
large
civilizations
.
this
is
probably
why
more
of
us
need
to
be
armed
.
but
not
enough
of
us
are
armed
,
so
there
's
more
murder
.
also
,
since
we
have
more
people
,
there
's
more
crazy
people
.
<new_line>
no
we
should
not
give
up
our
right
to
bear
arms
,
due
to
the
fact
it
has
been
around
as
long
as
america
has
been
born
.
plus

[
b]will

and
i
mean
[
b]will

]
be
lowered
in
fact
it
would
increase
and
i
know
for
a
fact
because
it
has
been
proving
already
by
some
places
in
england
,
they
banned
the
use
of
firearms
to
civilians
and
now
criminals
know
that
they
can
break
into
a
house
and
not
worry
about
getting
shot
because
they
can
get
there
hands
on
illegal
fire
-
arms
from
trades
and
such
forth
and
go
into
someones
home
put
them
at
gun
point
and
not
worry
about
the
civilian
having
a
weapon
to
shoot
back

that
s

?

<new_line>
i
think
this
is
what
they
mean
when
they
wrote
the
bill
of
rights
:
<new_line>
i
do
n't
know
about
the
rest
of
you
,
but
i
'm
no
fan
of
having
my
rights
,
stated
in
the
bill
of
rights
,
taken
away
from
me
.
you
can
read
the
2nd
amendment
anyway
you
want
,
but
i
know
when
i
read
it
,
it
says
i
can
keep
my
guns
!
!
<new_line>
you
can
take
my
guns
from
my
cold
dead
hands
!
it
is
my
got
given
right
and
is
part
of
the
constitution
for
a
reason
<new_line>
how
would
you
know
if
they
do
nt
like
the
way
their
country
is
run
,
they
can
t
speak
out
like
americans
can
<new_line>
"
hell
no
"
is
my
name
so
i
choose
this
option
!
go
hellno
!
<new_line>
i
will
never
give
up
my
bear
arms
!
they
look
so
good
hanging
over
my
fireplace
.
<new_line>
i
made
this
debate
but
do
nt
get
me
wrong
i
do
nt
think
gun
privaleges
should
be
taken
away
!
if
you
wanna
hunt
.
practice
shooting
,
or
keep
a
gun
for
self
defense
would
nt
these
be
for
the
better
?
so
many
people
break
laws
anyway
and
no
guns
will
make
people
mad
and
express
it
by
breaking
that
law
and
using
guns
in
a
violent
way
!
<new_line>
well
,
if
you
take
away
gun
rights
,
all
that
means
is
law
abiding
citizens
wo
n't
be
able
to
get
guns
.
so
,
when
all
the
law
breakers
get
their
underground
weapons
(
as
they
do
now
actually
)
,
they
can
have
the
upper
hand
since
law
abiding
citizens
wo
n't
have
anything
to
defend
themselves
with
.
basically
,
if
you
take
away
gun
rights
,
you
let
the
bad
people
have
control
<new_line>
if
they
take
away
the
right
to
own
guns
,
what
am
i
going
to
shoot
after
a
few
beers
?
<new_line>
that
s
great
but
the
second
amendments
primary
purpose
is
not
about
"
hunting
,
practice
shooting
or
self
defense
"
it
is
to
protect
its
citizens
from
the
government
.
<new_line>
owning
a
gun
should
not
be
a
privilege
in
the
first
place
,
it
's
a
right
granted
under
the
us
constitution
and
any
law
or
view
that
makes
it
a
privilege
in
the
first
place
is
unconstitutional
.
this
question
is
as
absurd
as
should
freedom
of
speech
,
press
and
religion
be
taken
away
.
if
you
want
to
take
away
the
right
to
bear
arms
then
change
the
constitution
,
otherwise
these
laws
that
weasel
around
it
and
make
it
a
privilege
should
not
be
tolerated
.
<new_line>
if
we
do
n't
have
are
right
to
guns
then
the
goverment
will
start
to
be
opressive
.
<new_line>
it
is
now
2015
and
the
gun
violence
is
reaching
terrible
proportions
in
the
united
states
.
<new_line>
the
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention
has
a
startling
revelation
for
2015
.
it
is
projected
that
deaths
from
guns
will
surpass
deaths
from
car
fatalities
in
2015
.
an
estimated
33,000
americans
will
lose
their
lives
from
guns
as
opposed
to
an
estimated
32,000
americans
who
will
die
in
car
accidents
.
the
gun
violence
in
america
is
an
american
shame
!

<new_line>
guns
help
protect
people
.
2.5
million
people
were
saved
last
year
because
of
guns
.
plus
,
criminals
do
n't
care
if
guns
are
not
legal
.
<new_line>
if
guns
should
be
banned
cars
should
be
banned
too
.
if
guns
kill
people
,
the
same
can
be
said
for
cars
.
they
are
both
useful
and
dangerous
.
they
both
kill
a
lot
of
people
every
year
.
my
point
is
that
guns
and
cars
are
both
useful
and
that
there
is
no
good
reason
to
ban
them
.
<new_line>
no
because
then
people
will
be
completely
defenseless
against
the
police
&
criminals
.
&
weak
people
wo
n't
be
able
to
defend
themselfs
against
stronger
people
.
<new_line>
i
can
prove
that
statistic
here
:
http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1071444
<new_line>
even
guns
are
banned
people
are
still
going
to
find
a
way
to
get
guns
.
all
we
are
doing
is
creating
another
scarface
and
it
states
under
the
second
amendment
that
we
shall
bear
arms
<new_line>
if
guns
are
banned
,
the
only
people
that
will
be
affected
will
be
the
people
that
buy
guns
for
protection
from
criminals
,
who
get
their
guns
illegally
anyway
.
<new_line>
to
quote
a
wise
man
,
"
guns
are
designed
to
protect
people
against
people
with
smaller
guns
.
"
i
wonder
if
the
nra
-
loons
ever
wonder
why
our
country
happens
to
have
one
of
the
highest
per
-
capita
rates
of
gun
ownership
,
as
well
as
one
of
the
highest
rate
of
gun
-
related
deaths
?
<new_line>
oh
please
,
that
's
a
survey
.
not
exactly
the
most
reliable
scientific
data
.
they
even
admit
that
"
their
own
estimates
were
too
high
and
that
some
respondents
may
have
exaggerated
their
defensive
use
of
guns
"
.
a
:
"
so
,
how
many
people
do
you
think
you
saved
by
shooting
that
hobo
,
in
self
-
defense
of
course
?
"
b
:
"
oh
,
i
must
have
saved
at
least
a
million
people
.
that
was
the
hilter
of
hobos
!
"
<new_line>
cars
have
many
uses
that
do
n't
involve
killing
things
.
guns
have
few
uses
that
do
n't
involve
killing
things
.
<new_line>
so
by
your
logic
,
everyone
in
canada
and
europe
must
have
been
murdered
by
criminals
and
crooked
police
,
since
they
have
such
low
rates
of
gun
ownership
?
<new_line>
so
should
we
legalize
murder
then
?
after
all
,
people
are
going
to
figure
out
how
to
kill
other
people
even
if
we
illegalize
murder
.
<new_line>
what
is
your
point
?
if
i
want
to
have
a
firearm
in
my
house
,
i
can
.
it
does
n't
matter
how
useful
you
think
it
is
.
<new_line>
banning
guns
would
n't
be
the
smartest
thing
to
do
.
we
would
just
be
turning
them
into
"
forbidden
fruit
"
and
by
doing
so
,
we
will
create
more
chaos
in
the
world
.
<new_line>
sure
it
does
.
to
see
why
,
imagine
your
neighbour
had
grenades
,
a
tank
,
chemical
weapons
,
or
a
nuclear
bomb
in
their
house
.
would
you
sleep
soundly
at
night
?
might
you
wonder
what
kind
of
use
he
had
in
mind
for
those
weapons
?
one
of
the
roles
of
government
is
to
protect
people
from
each
other
.
if
joe
sixpack
wants
to
buy
a
machine
gun
so
he
can
mow
down
a
herd
of
deer
,
that
's
fine
...
in
a
disturbing
sort
of
way
.
however
,
the
more
destructive
a
weapon
becomes
,
the
more
likely
it
'll
be
used
intentionally
on
another
person
for
reasons
other
than
self
-
defense
.
that
's
why
the
public
has
an
interest
in
regulating
,
if
not
outright
banning
guns
.
<new_line>
it
is
quite
simple
.
idiots
can
have
guns
.
if
you
put
an
idiot
and
a
gun
together
bad
things
are
gon
na
happen
.
to
solve
this
gun
buyers
should
be
encouraged
to
attend
a
gun
safety
class
.
<new_line>
none
of
those
are
guns
!
 
if
someone
breaks
into
your
house
and
he
/
she
has
a
gun
would
you
still
be
for
banning
guns
?
or
would
you
blow
the
mother
f*er
's
head
of
?
<new_line>
they
're
weapons
.
you
ca
n't
discuss
banning
guns
without
banning
other
deadly
weapons
in
general
.
seeing
as
how
no
one
has
ever
broken
into
my
house
with
a
gun
,
or
anyone
i
know
of
,
i
'm
not
too
concerned
with
that
scenario
.
i
'd
be
much
more
concerned
about
accidentally
shooting
myself
or
someone
else
.
<new_line>
well
just
because
you
ca
n't
handle
a
gun
does
not
mean
that
more
responsible
people
ca
n't
either
.
<new_line>
i
do
nt
even
know
what
to
say
to
that
stupid
liberal
statement
.
guns
should
not
be
banned
.
the
police
will
have
even
more
power
over
us
than
they
do
now
.
they
are
megalomaniacs
.
<new_line>
"
imagine
your
neighbor
had
grenades
,
a
tank
,
chemical
weapons
,
or
a
nuclear
bomb
in
their

.
would
you
sleep
soundly
at

?
"
no
,
but
if
they
legally
owned
a
handgun
or
a
rifle
i
would
.
but
chances
are
i
would
n't
know
.
 
protection
.
that
s
why
it
's
legal
for
me
to
own
a
weapon
in
my
house
,
that
s
why
the
founding
fathers
thought
it
necessary
.
see
grenades
are
n't
legal
to
own
in
my
house
.
because
they
are
not
a
valid
source
of
protection
for
if
a
stranger
came
into
my
house
at
night
to
steal
my
things
and
threaten
my
life
.
 
are
you
kidding
me
!
?
that
's
why
i
'm
allowed
to
own
a
firearm
!
if
somebody
breaks
into
my
house
at
night
and
comes
at
me
with
a
knife
i
can
take
out
my
smith
and
wesson
500
magnum
revolver
and
peel
some
led
.
<new_line>
so
if
the
whole
self
-
defense
argument
is
the
most
popular
argument
for
guns
being
legal
,
then
where
do
you
draw
the
line
on
self
-
defense
?
should
i
be
able
to
own
an
automatic
weapons
to
defend
myself
?
what
about
a
grenade
launcher
?
scud
missiles
?
a
tank
?
<new_line>
i
do
n't
really
agree
with
either
side
.
i
do
n't
think
guns
are
good
or
bad
.
i
think
they
're
just
...
guns
.
to
say
they
're
bad
,
implies
they
're
useless
;
to
say
they
're
good
,
implies
they
're
beneficial
.
i
'm
kind
of
in
the
center
on
this
topic
.
i
do
n't
like
that
ordinary
citizens
can
buy
guns
for
"
protection
.
"
i
do
n't
give
a
sh*t
how
much
they
think
it
'll
save
them
against
a
burglar
or
rapist
or
whatever
.
because
there
's
still
the
increased
risk
(
which
outweighs
the
protection
factor
)
of
it
being
used
for
the
wrong
reasons
,
or
of
kids
getting
their
hands
on
it
,
or
of
just
standard
reckless
usage
.
why
not
every
get
off
their
ass
and
use
the
money
for
karate
lessons
instead
?
just
because
at
some
point
someone
might
hold
a
gun
on
you
,
does
n't
mean
you
need
to
lower
yourself
to
their
level
and
do
the
same
.
however
,
i
am
for
police
and
the
military
having
guns
,
at
the
very
least
.
at
least
they
're
more
properly
trained
for
using
them
and
in
certain
situations
.
so
,
with
that
said
,
i
'd
rather
guns
were
just
not
available
to
the
general
public
,
period
.
if
they
want
better
protection
,
there
are
many
other
options
.
how
about
stun
guns
?
electrocute
those
balls
!
hehe
.
<new_line>
if
you
ban
guns
people
will
not
be
able
to
defend
themselves
from
a
burglar
.
what
if
the
criminals
get
guns
and
honest
folks
do
not
have
them
?
well
,
no
one
would
be
safe
,
<new_line>
"
guns
do
nt
kill
,
ppl
do
"
do
you
know
that
canada
has
more
armed
citizens
and
less
murders
.
and
that
is
with
pot
being
legal
.
not
only
that
but
the
us
consitution
specifically
says
that
guns
are
allowed
and
that
is
so
that
we
can
not
be
oppressed
by
the
government
.
if
we
are
all
helpless
,
than
how
can
we
fight
back
?
<new_line>
whether
guns
were
banned
or
not
,
people
will
still
find
a
way
to
illegally
obtain
them
--
especially
criminals
.
those
who
abide
by
the
law
would
be
left
defenseless
if
and
when
their
life
is
threatened
.
it
's
our
right
to
bear
arms
,
and
i
believe
that
it
is
fairly
reasonable
to
exercise
that
right
.
<new_line>
guns
are
used
for
protecting
first
,
if
you
want
kill
sb
,
other
tools
can
do
it
,
not
only
guns
,
so
it
is
not
the
guns
fault
,
why
guns
should
be
banned
?
<new_line>
a
guns
is
a
weapon
that
kills
.
every
year
children
die
in
the
us
due
to
firearms
.
if
you
had
a
child
who
was
killed
by
a
accidental
shot
,
you
would
be
most
upset
.
if
we
put
tougher
laws
on
them
,
or
even
ban
them
,
we
should
drop
the
rate
of
death
considerably
.
<new_line>
children
also
get
killed
by
household
cleaners
should
we
ban
those
too
?
instead
taking
guns
away
parents
should
put
their
guns
in
a
safe
place
that
is
away
from
their
children
.
the
reason
for
children
getting
killed
by
guns
is
that
the
parents
do
not
take
the
necessary
measures
to
ensure
that
their
children
are
safe
.
<new_line>
there
are
many
people
out
there
where
a
gun
has
saved
their
life
or
another
member
of
their
family
.
it
is
also
too
bad
that
some
gun
owners
became
gun
owners
after
something
tragic
has
happened
to
them
.
<new_line>
guns
should
be
banned
.
u
never
know
when
and
where
and
who
will
suddenly
pick
up
a
gun
and
start
a
shooting
rampage
.
what
's
the
use
of
owning
a
gun
to
protect
yourself
when
u
got
attacked
by
someone
who
suddenly
come
out
from
nowhere
n
shoot
at
u.
u
would
die
already
before
reacting
to
take
out
your
gun
to
fight
back
.
the
country
will
be
safer
to
ban
private
guns
.
<new_line>
umm
yes
you
have
the
right
to
bear
arms
.
so
mount
them
on
your
wall
.
do
n't
go
around
carrying
a
gun
,
....
smh
idiot
...
<new_line>
guns
are
dangerous
.
in
the
wrong
hands
,
they
can
cause
unnecessary
deaths
.
<new_line>
so
let
me
get
this
straight
:
1
.
you
state
that
without
guns
,
we
'll
get
killed
/
imprisioned
/
brutalized
/
etc
.
2
.
i
prove
you
wrong
by
stating
the
fact
that
other
countries
have
little
gun
ownership
but
are
not
being
killed
/
imprisioned
/
brutalized
/
etc
.
3
.
you
're
only
counterargument
is
an
ad
hominem
attack
.
"
guns
should
not
be
banned
.
the
police
will
have
even
more
power
over
us
than
they
do
now
.
"
i
do
n't
see
your
point
.
are
you
implying
that
when
you
're
unhappy
with
the
police
,
you
go
out
and
start
shooting
them
,
or
at
least
intimidate
them
with
threat
of
violence
?
in
what
world
is
that
valid
logic
for
owning
a
gun
?
we
're
a
nation
of
laws
.
when
police
abuse
their
authority
,
they
're
dealt
with
by
the
law
.
whenever
i
hear
about
a
dirty
cop
being
exposed
,
it
's
due
to
a
reporter
or
a
pedestrian
with
a
camcorder
,
not
some
guy
with
a
shotgun
.
<new_line>
his
logic
is
that
with
no
firearms
owned
by
the
people
of
a
country
,
it
allows
things
like
government
,
police
and
criminals
to
seize
power
,
control
its
people
and
turn
into
a
totalitarian
state
.
as
i
recall
such
a
thing
has
happened
in
europe
,
russia
and
china
just
in
the
past
century
.
what
happens
when
the
police
have
power
over
its
people
...
things
like
waco
and
ruby
ridge
happen
,
or
more
recently
people
in
the
middle
of
the
katrina
disaster
were
disarmed
by
the
police
state
and
left
to
rot
in
the
middle
of
a
destroyed
city
full
of
criminals
.
the
job
of
the
government
is
to
serve
its
people
,
not
take
control
of
people
as
if
they
are
subjects
.
the
second
amendment
is
the
least
understood
out
of
everything
in
the
constitution
,
and
little
do
you
seem
to
know
,
that
if
you
throw
this
one
out
,
you
might
as
well
throw
them
all
out
.
anyone
who
wants
to
ban
firearms
is
either
ignorant
from
fear
,
or
does
not
value
their
freedom
.
there
is
a
reason
it
is
the
second
part
to
the
most
important
part
of
the
constitution
.
<new_line>
we
should
ban
guns
,
because
,
adults
or
even
kids
could
get
their
hands
on
them
,
and
can
cause
unneccessary
deaths
<new_line>
guns
do
n't
kill
people
....
people
kill
people
so
guns
should
nt
be
banned
people
can
kill
with
knifes
and
all
sorts
of
things
so
guns
should
n't
be
banned
cause
many
people
enjoy
shooting
them
and
if
someone
had
an
intention
to
kill
someone
they
would
kill
them
without
a
gun
if
they
wanted
to
so
no
guns
should
not
be
banned
and
guns
are
used
to
hunt
to
so
that
's
about
it
<new_line>
think
aboit
this
what
would
you
do
if
someone
broke
in
to
your
house
and
the
power
and
cell
phone
recption
was
down
and
u
had
no
way
to
call
the
cops
and
handguns
where
band
what
would
you
do
if
that
happens
?
<new_line>
guns
help
protect
people
when
a
robber
comes
into
there
home
they
can
shoot
him
maybe
because
they
are
defending
there
home
<new_line>

<new_line>
guns
are
good
.
but
this
is
an
old
debate
.
i
do
n't
see
how
it
got
revived
.
<new_line>
if
guns
were
legal
,
and
someone
got
drunk
...
do
i
even
have
to
say
anymore
?
<new_line>
people
could
go
mad
and
just
shoot
everyone
,
and
who
wants
to
live
in
a
world
where
they
are
constantly
at
risk
of
being
shot
?
<new_line>
.....
are
you
for
real
?
<new_line>
you
simply
can
not
take
away
our
right
to
own
guns
what
happens
if
a
serial
rapist
/
murderer
breaks
into
your
house
with
an
illegal
gun
?
even
if
you
heard
him
break
in
and
called
the
cops
it
still
takes
a
while
for
them
to
respond
so
while
the
cops
are
taking
their
sweet
ass
time
to
get
here
the
bad
guy
has
all
the
time
he
needs
to
kill
you
rape
your
wife
and
daughter
then
kill
of
anyone
else
and
steal
whatever
he
wants
then
he
is
free
to
go
before
the
cops
even
get
there
so
would
you
rather
the
cops
show
up
to
find
a
house
full
of
deap
people
or
a
house
full
of
safe
people
because
you
were
able
to
shoot
the
bad
guy
and
disarm
him
.....
if
obama
allows
this
gun
ban
to
happen
i
think
someone
should
go
to
the
white
house
and
beat
him
half
to
death
with
a
stick
then
write
a
note
in
his
blood
that
says
"
go
ahead
ban
wood
.....
"
what
if
i
killed
someone
with
a
furbie
.....
what
exactly
is
the
logical
thing
to
do
ban
furbies
?
yes
some
poor
bastard
was
bludgeoned
to
death
with
a
furbie
....
its
the
furbies
fault
!
!
!
!
destroy

guns
are
the
top
killer
weapon
in
usa
.
although
people
might
say
that
it
is
for
self
-
defence
,
it
is
used
as
a
weapon
and
it
is
a
non
-
living
thing
that
means
a
living
thing
,
a
person
,
is
the
cause
of
the
deaths
or
injuries
from
the
gun
.
in
other
countries
,
people
can
smuggle
or
illegally
buy
them
to
cause
disturbance
or
deaths
.
in
the
hands
of
a
crazy
or
brainless
person
,
the
item
can
now
be
called
very
dangerous
.
to
be
exact
,
its
not
the
gun
but
the
person
who
is
bad
or
insane
.
<new_line>
disarmed
people

are
dominated
people
simple
as
that
so
do
we
really
want
to
ban
guns
?
<new_line>
if
guns
are
banned
,
there
will
obviously
be
less
guns
in
circulation
.
although
most
criminals
get
their
guns
illegally
,
there
will
be
less
to
get
illegally
.
also
,
the
police
officers
can
protect
you
.
consider
that
you
do
n't
need
an
m16
lying
around
the
house
.
<new_line>
no
way
.
you
can
use
guns
for
self
defense
.
just
use
it
in
a
coorect
way
so
that
you
wo
n't
kill

much

here

<new_line>
the

a

revelation
for

it
is
projected
that
deaths
from

will
surpass
deaths
from
car
fatalities
in
2015
.
an

33,000

will
lose
their

from

to
an

32,000

<new_line>
people
need
the
right
of
defense
,
safty
,
a
gun
.
people
argue
that
it
will
just
put
guns
in
the
wrong
hands
,
but
are
nt
they
already
?
really
will
makeing
it
illegal
do
anything
?
i
think
not
,
because
its
not
guns
that
kills
people
,
its
people
.
the
gun
wo
nt
kill
you
without
someone
behind
it
,
not
all
people
have
the
right
reasons
for
haveing
a
gun
,
but
does
that
mean
people
who
do
have
the
right
reasons
will
be
punished
and
left
unarmed
,
and
defensless
?
<new_line>
i
think
that
the
statement
of
"
guns
kill
people
.
guns
kill
children
"
is
totally
true
.
but
people
try
and
tell
you
that
its
the
person
that
uses
the
gun
to
kill
that
people
and
the
children
or
they
could
have
a
mental
disease
that
makes
them
do
it
and
then
later
they
do
n't
understand
what
they
did
.
wrong
.
i
think
that
if
somebody
is
mental
,
they
should
even
get
a
gun
.
i
feel
that
only
police
and
other
people
in
that
group
of
upper
class
people
like
that
should
be
the
only
ones
with
guns
and
weapons
like
that
.
well
what
about
the
defense
of
people
?
what
if
you
get
robbed
and
he
has
a
weapon
(
not
a
gun
)
and
you
have
nothing
to
defend
yourself
because
of
this
law
.
well
that
sucks
(:
no
with
less
guns
getting
robbed
should
n't
be
a
big
deal
...
use
a
frying
pan
or
something
to
protect
yourself
or
better
yet
call
the
cops
.
but
guns
do
kill
people
and
children
,
yes
it
is
fair
that
police
and
upper
class
or
that
enforcement
get
guns
(
they
need
them
and
use
them
for
a
purpose
)
.
the
rights
for
gun
should
be
limited
for
the
people
that
use
them
for
the
bad
reasons
and
give
them
to
the
people
that
use
them
for
good
reasons
to
help
and
save
peoples
lives
(:
<new_line>
we
should
protect
gun
laws
because
of
crazy
people
who
go
out
of
control
with
them
and
guns
these
days
are
getting
more
advanced
and
easier
to
get
<new_line>
yo
.
law
abiding
citizens
should
be
allowed
to
have
guns
,
not
convicted
criminals
.
if
someone
plans
to
buy
a
gun
,
the
shop
owner
should
have
to
do
a
background
check
on
the
customer
.
that
way
,
law
abiding
citizens
can
be
the
ones
with
guns
,
that
they
'll
only
use
for
protection
against
intruders
.
i
mean
,
come
on
.
if
you
think
that
gun
control
will
help
this
country
,
you
are
sorely
mistaken
.
criminals
are
n't
stupid
.
they
'll
keep
their
guns
while
the
law
-
abiding
citizens
while
fork
'em
over
to
the

.
i
think
you
see
where
i
'm
going
with
this
.
every
citizen
law
abiding
citizen
has
the
right
to
bear
arms
.
<new_line>
i
think
that
people
should
be
able
to
have
guns
because
they
might
need
them
to
protect
themselves
if
they
live
in
a
bad
neighborhood
and
it
is
in
the
bill
of
rights
.
<new_line>
people
have
rights
.
this
is
a
free
country
.
we
have
the
right
to
defend
ourselves
,
but
guns
should
come
with
a
rule
book
.
just
my
oppinion
tho
.
<new_line>
people
abuse
gun
rights
to
rob
places
and
take
hostages
.
people
say
that
you
need
guns
to
protect
yourself
but
do
you
really
have
time
to
find
your
gun
if
you
are
taken
hostage
.
usualy
the
people
commiting
the
crime
are
more
prepared
and
ready
to
strike
<new_line>
i
think
if
people
are
responsible
they
should
be
able
to
buy
and
use
firarms
.
but
there
s
some
people
who
use
them
for
the
wrong
reason
and
that
is
what
makes
little
familys
cry
because
there
loved
one
was
gunned
down
by
a
horable
person

one
needs

defense
,
one
needs
the
right
to

safe
in
any
circumstance
.
yet
one
also
needs
to
know
self
restraint
,
such
weapons
as
a

weapons
should
not
be
allowed

a
hunting

and

should
be
allowed

<new_line>
guns
are
very
easy
to
get

anyone
can
use

to
kill

<new_line>
ya
brad
if
the

that
the
robbers
were
gon
na
take
hostage
have
guns
they
can
show
them
what
s
up
<new_line>
brad
,
just
because
the
criminals
may
be
more
prepared
and
we
might
not
have
the
time
to
grab
our
gun
that
does
nt
mean
that
guns
should
nt
be
alowed
,
all
your
saying
is
based

and
luck
<new_line>
people
should
have
the

to
bear

.
if
guns
were
to
be
banned
,
people
would
still
have
them
in
their
homes
and
on
the
streets
.
its
just
how
things
work
.
some
people
say
that
taking
away
the
right
to
bear
arms
will
decrease
crime
rate
,
but
when
the
righs
is
taken
away
,
more
damage
will
be
done

we

student
news
daily
offers
lots
of
policial
stamensts
about
popular
topic
today
.
in
a
chart
compairing
conservitive
and
liberal
views
,
there
was
the
following
quote
;
"
the
second
amendment
gives
no
individual
the
right
to
own
a
gun
,
but
allows
the
state
to
keep
a
militia
(
national
guard
)
.
guns
kill
people
.
guns
kill
children
.
"
for
example
,
during
a
year
when
over
5,000
teens
and
children
died
from
gun
wounds
in
the
usa
,
in
great
britain
,
where
gun
ownership
is
very
restricted
,
19
teens
and
children
died
from
gun
wounds
.
this
is
very
blunt
statistic
proof
that
states
that
gun
control
that
s
rectricted
to
certian
personal
keep
citizens
safe
and
reduces
the
death
by
guns
.
with
society
and
technology
proggressing
at
such
a
fast
speed
,
the
need
for
barbaric
uses
of
protections
such
as
guns
is
not
nessicary
.
guns
can
be
unpredictable
and
almost
84
%
of
americans
have
not
been
trained
in
gun
safety
.
with
the
uses
of
modern
day
technoloy
for
individual
protection
,
gun
control
should
only
be
restriced
to
select
forces
of
the
goverment
who
are
trained
in
using
these
weapons
.
a
huge
part
of
american
culture
is
film
,
and
if
you
were
to
ask
people
if
violence
and
special
effects
involiving
guns
and
other
firing
weapons
were
nessicary
to
a
good
film
,
one
out
of
two
would
say
yes
.
this
point
gets
even
more
drastic
then
a
50/50
when
i
comes
to
videos
games
,
once
you
past
rated
"
e
"
there
it
is
almost
impossible
to
find
a
game
with
no
use
of
guns
.
taking
gun
use
as
a
"
game
"
only
provokes
the
wrong
use
of
these
weapons
and
teaches
the
brian
that
guns
can
be
an
"
easy
way
or
"
or
a
"
simple
defense
"
.
not
only
do
adults
play
games
,
so
do
children
.
my
11
year
old
brother
is
a
avid
player
of
the
new
first
person
shooter
modern
warfare2
.
this
game
is
fast
paced
and
above
all
violent
,
take
a
look
in
the
video
below
.
modern
warefare
may
ahve
the
rating
m
but
its
very
common
for
children
to
play
these
games
.
some
may
argue
that
these
"
train
to
be

"
but
how
does
jamming
down
the
"

in

make
you
a
good
soilder
in
training
?
simple
anwser
,
it
does
n't
.
we
can
not
have
guns
in
the
same
enviorment
as
play
.
teaching
people
that
firing
a
gun
gives
you
points
is
not
what
they
should
know
.
firing
that
gun
kills
another
human
being
and
will
haunt
you
for
the
rest
of
your
life
.
infact
you
may
have
heard
about
how
many
soilders
who
come
back
from
the
war
suffer
from
many
phycological
issues
that
in
many
cases
can
not
be
completely
cured
.
we
should
leave
the
guns
to
the
people
who
need
to
use
them
.
we
as
citizens
need
to
be
protected
,
not
be
armed
.
to
keep
the
country
both
mentally
and
physically
safe
,
we
need
to
keep
reality
and
virtual

seperate

<new_line>
the

i
posted
this
on
a
similar
debate
and
i
believe
it
clearly
shows
my
views
:
i
agree
that
one
should
have
the
right
to
own
arms
but
i
do
not
believe
on
has
to
use
violence
to
obtain
their
wildest
gun
dreams
.
if
one
wants
to
own
a
gun
i
have
no
qualms
with
them
but
if
they
wish
to
own
guns
such
as
a
ak47
and
ak74u
they
should
be
dealt
with
in
a
more
civilized
manner
to
protect
the
people
.
a
hunting
rifle
is
fine
,
a
pistol
is
fine
,
an
automatic
or
assault
rifle
is
over
doing
it
specially
since
the
only
reason
an
american
needs
a
gun
such
as
a
rifle
is
for
hunting
.
i
am
not
saying
all
guns
are
for
hunting
a
pistol
may
be
used
for
self
defense
,
but
only
as
a
deterrence
to
violence
.
<new_line>
with
all
the
other
types
of
self
defenise
available
and
the
many
more
being
created
,
i
do
nt
think
something
as
barbaric
as
a
good
should
be
the
"
fall
back
defensive
.
"
<new_line>
i
think
that
we
should
all
have
the
right
to
own
a
gun
because
most
people
use
then
for
protection
or
hunting
so
we
should
and
people
that
do
nt
use
then
for
that
reason
might
just
have
then
to
just
have
then
<new_line>
the
general
public
should
be
able
to
posses
guns
for
self
defense
and
safety
.
i
agree
that
there
should
be
some
restrictions
like
if
you
are
a
convicted
felon
you
are
not
aloud
to
posses
a
gun
.
but
a
citizen
trying
to
protect
himself
should
be
able
to
have
a
gun
.
some
may
say
that
crime
happens
because
of
guns
.
guns
do
n't
kill
people
,
people
do
.
but
even
if
guns
were
outlawed
the
criminals
would
find
illegal
guns
and
would
find
other
ways
to
harm
people
.
all
people
should
n't
have
they
're
safety
taken
away
just
because
of
what
criminals
decide
to
do
with
the
guns
.
<new_line>
you
go
to
school
everyday
with
the
requirement
to
not
bare
arms
and
do
you
honestly
feel
defenseless
?
84
%
of
americans
have
nt
taken
one
safety
course
on
guns
so
its
a
threat
to
anyone
,
behind
and
infront
of
the
gun
.
in
alot
of
gun
injuries
,
the
user
is
harmed
too
.
guns
should
be
left
in
trained
haneds
and
with
all
the
other
types
of
defense
methods
,
guns
should
not
be
the
defult
.
<new_line>
psst
,
criminals
do
n't
plan
on
following
gun
laws
,
so
banning
guns
will
not
prevent
robberies
or
crimes
.
<new_line>
people
kill
people
,
but
guns
make
it
a
heck
of
a
lot
easier
.
i
do
not
think
all
guns
should
be
banned
,
but
some
should
.
if
you
like
to
hunt
,
and
you
want
to
kill
a
deer
,
then
go
out
and
by
a
hunting
rifle
.
however
,
certain
guns
are
overkill
such
as
ak-47
's
.
i
do
not
think
you
need
a
machine
gun
to
kill
a
deer
.
you
may
say
that
guns
could
be
used
for
personal
protection
,
however
i
think
buying
a
gun
for
that
reason
is
stupid
and
paranoid
because
there
are
so
many
other
things
you
can
do
before
resorting
to
a
gun
for
protection
.
you
could
move
to
a
place
with
a
lower
crime
rate
,
or
by
a
taser/
pepper
spray
.
you
could
get
a
guard
dog
,
but
the
main
idea
is
that
there
is
little
purpose
for
guns
other
than
their
use
for
killing
,
and
that
is
why
i
am
against
gun
rights
.
<new_line>
guns
have
no
purpose
other
then
killing
.
i
do
not
think
all
guns
should
be
banned
,
but
definitely
some
.
if
you
like
to
hunt
,
then
go
out
and
buy
a
hunting
rifle
.
however
i
believe
guns
such
as
ak-47
's
serve
no
purpose
.
they
are
machine
guns
,
and
you
do
not
need
a
machine
gun
to
hunt
a
deer
.
as
for
self
defense
,
well
there
are
plenty
of
things
you
can
do
before
resorting
to
a
gun
for
defense
.
you
could
move
to
a
place
with
a
lower
crime
rate
.
buy
a
taser
or
pepper
spray
.
get
an
alarm
or
guard
dog
.
besides
,
what
would
you
need
a
gun
for
to
defend
yourself
?
if
it
is
against
a
robber
then
i
should
let
you
know
that
most
robberies
occur
when
you
are
away
from
home
,
making
the
gun
pointless
.
<new_line>
your
side
sounds
more
"
against
gun
control
"
.
responsible
people
,
in
my
opinion
,
are
the
ones
who
have
been
trained
and
are
armed
with
guns
under
government
authorization
.
which
is
quite
rarely
an
average
american
citizen
.
you
state
,
"
but
there
s
some
people
who
use
them
for
the
wrong
reason
and
that
is
what
makes
little
familys
cry
because
there
loved
one
was
gunned
down
by
a
horable
person

this
comment
should
be

the
comment
instead
of
on
the
"
arguments

"
side
.
this
side
is
for
your
individual
comments
,
as
to
debate
with
you
,
guns
should
not
be
aloud
in
the
hands
of
citizens
because
it
is
the
gun
that
kills
the
people
,
the
person
.
if
the
person
was
responsible
,
you
could
take
the
gun
out
of
the
situation
and
someone
would
still
die
,
this
is
not
true
.
the
gun
is
what
is
directly
taking
the
human
life
.
to
say
that
quote
is
false
is
just
commonly
statisticly
untrue
,
as
stated
in
my
argument
against
;
"
for
example
,
during
a
year
when
over
5,000
teens
and
children
died
from
gun
wounds
in
the
usa
,
in
great
britain
,
where
gun
ownership
is
very
restricted
,
19
teens
and
children
died
from
gun
wounds
.
"
<new_line>
although
its
not
your
idea
,
i
think
its
still
well
formed
.
my
dispute
is
that
hunting
and
other
recreational
guns
should
be
stored
safely
in
the
place
where
the
recreation
is
taking
place
.
for
example
,
hunting
guns
should
be
stored
under
lock
and
key
at
those
hunting
grounds
,
then
checked
out
and
returned
as
not
to
take
them
home
cause
harm
to
non
-
deer
life
like
humans
.
as
for
the
topic
of
self
defense
,
guns
should
not
be
used
as
a
common
self
defense
.
why
?
lets
use
a
simple
example
,
your
walking
home
in
the
dark
its
quite
and
you
think
someones
following
you
so
have
your
hand
on
the
gun
and
keep
walking
,
looking
back
.
suddenly
a
car
pulls
in
front
of
you
,
startled
you
naturally
turn
around
and
shoot
.
theirs
no
one
behind
you
,
but
an
innocent
dead
driver
in
front
of
you
.
its
simple
"
accidents
"
like
these
account
for
most
deaths
.
having
something
less
likely
to
kill
a
person
,
such
as
a
taser
,
is
much
safer
.
some
people
may
argue
that
it
does
nt
do
enough
damage
to
defend
somone
,
but
taserd
stop
your
muscles
from
moving
,
stopping
whoever
right
in
their
tracks
,
alive
.
we
should
stop
using
guns
for
defense
like
we
do
,
nothing
that
deadly
should
be
so
self
conscious
.
<new_line>
even
if
a
background
check
is
preformed
and
comes
out
clean
,
most
americans
have
no
history
of
gun
safety
.
also
,
though
americans
may
be
"
law
abiding
"
they
still
are
animals
and
have
natural
reactions
,
there
is
no
human
alive
that
has
nt
been
startled
before
or
scared
.
its
those
feelings
that
provoke
gun
use
as
a
defense
in
the
first
place
.
if
you
want
defense
against
intruders
,
try
a
home
alarm
system
,
a
loud
barking
dog
will
even
warn
you
without
killing
someone
.
if
you
want
to
stop
someone
,
use
another
form
of
defense
like
a
taser
.
some
people
may
say
,
but
what
if
they
have
a
gun
?
if
there
was
gun
control
,
that
could
nt
be
the
case
,
yes
there
will
always
be
violent
people
,
but
without
guns
there
would
be
less
dead
people
.
at
school
no
one
has
a
gun
,
its
just
how
it
is
,
and
in
the
cases
where
one
was
entered
into
the
environment
,
there
was
a
set
plan
to
stay
safe
and
the
deaths
are
obviously
lower
from
that
event
,
then
they
would
be
if
guns
were
aloud
daily
.
guns
make
room
for
emotional
mistakes
and
kill
the
need
for
restraint
.
i
do
think
gun
control
will
help
this
country
and
i
am
not
mistaken
.
if
criminals
keep
their
guns
,
they
wo
nt
be
able
to
use
them
.
why
?
people
if
no
one
had
a
gun
in
an
area
and
one
single
shot
was
heard
,
the
whole
area
would
be
on
alert
for
that
one
shot
and
the
gun
would
get
confiscated
.
in
countries
like
great
britan
where
there
is
strict
gun
control
,
this
happens
all
the
time
.
if
we
just
assume
its
useless
cause
we
have
some
criminals
and
just
have
to
bare
arms
to
balance
it
out
then
its
just
twice
as
dangerous
,
two
lefts
do
n't
make
a
right
.
anyone
that
is
considered
a
"
criminal
"
is
on
record
by
the
us
government
and
will
be
searched
before
the
citizens
for
that
reason
.
the
government
is
smart
enough
to
realize
that
criminals
would
have
guns
,
its
not
something
that
s
just
overlooked
.
<new_line>
this
comment
should
be
under
brads
statement
,
but
to
dispute
.
timing
may
just
be
a
statement
but
the
guns
are
still
the
main
focus
.
guns
should
nt
be
allow
because
the
defenders
want
to
shoot
just
as
much
as
the
intruders
.
i
think
i
covered
this
in
more
detail
when
i
explained
the
pros
of
having
citizens
being
gun
free
.
even
"
if
criminals
keep
their

we
were
to
confiscate
all
guns
)
"
they
wo
nt
be

<new_line>
the
about
80
%
of
the
"
general
public
"
do
nt
even
know
a
thing
about
gun
safety
.
although
i
agree
that
criminals
should
not
possess
guns
,
at
least
most
of
them
know
how
to
use
it
.
citizens
trying
to
protect
themselves
should
use
something
that
wo
nt
kill
people
with
a
flick
of
a
finger
.
pepper
spray
can
blind
,
tasers
will
stop
someone
wherever
they
stand
,
guns
click
and
kill
.
i
said
this
in
jacobs
dispute
,
but
if
people
were
the
ones
killing
people
then
it
would
nt
matter
if
there
was
a
gun
involved
.
umm
heres
a
visual
person+gun=
-person
(
a
person
with
a
gun
kills
a
person
)
take
out
the
gun
cause
your
saying
its
not
its
fault
...
person=-person
if
the
gun
was
nt
responsible
,
and
its
the
persons
fault
,
then
it
would
nt
matter
if
the
gun
was
there
or
not
.
but
infact
it
makes
quite
the
difference
.
your
point
about
criminals
finding
illegal
guns
is
just
like
illegal
guns
,
something
just
ca
nt
be
completely
erased
.
but
saying
outlawing
them
would
make
gun
rate
increase
cause
they
are
illegal
makes
no
logical
sense
.
take
a
place
like
school
,
we
have
no
guns
here
,
and
in
cases
where
shootings
happen
,
its
much
less
then
i
would
be
if
people
had
guns
everyday
.
same
goes
for
a
biggerscale
like
the
usa
.
we
also
have
all
been
trained
with
the
lock
down
drill
,
and
i
m
certain
the
government
would
issue
something
like
that
as
well
.
the
people
behind
the
guns
"
defending
"
themselves
are
just
as
trigger
happy
as
any
intruder
.
to
just
say
guns
should
be
aloud
because
criminals
have
them
,
is
childish
and
we
need
to
age
past
barbaric
murder
caused
by
guns
.
<new_line>
the
bill
of
rights
does
not
state
the
an
individual
citizen
has
their
own
right
to
have
their
own
gun
,
i
d
read
up
on
that
before
making
that
statement
.
people
who
live
in
a
bad
neighbor
hood
can
move
,
or
live
in
a
protected
shelter
if
moving
is
not
an
option
.
people
who
consider
a
neighborhood
unsafe
often
think
so
because
of
guns
.
i
myself
often
think
"
someones
gon
na
come
out
and
shoot
me
"
when
walking
through
bad
neighborhoods
.
if
citizens
did
n't
have
guns
,
that
would
make
everyone
feel
that
much
safer
.
in
unsafe
neighborhoods
,
there
would
be
one
less
worry
of
not
getting
hurt
by
some
irresponsible
citizen
with
a
gun
.
<new_line>
i
feel
like
i
m
repeating
myself
.
but
to
simplify
what
i
ve
been
saying
,
if
the
government
had
gun
control
they
would
start
out
with
the
high
risk
people
such
as
criminals
and
work
their
way
down
.
not
having
guns
would
be
an
overall
safer
environment
.
a
common
environment
like
this
is
school
.
some
people
argue
that
there
are
still
school
shootings
and
this
is
true
and
also
related
to
your
idea
of
"
its
just
how
things
work
.
"
while
their
are
school
shooting
they
are
vary
rare
,
just
like
america
would
be
if
we
did
nt
have
guns
.
schools
also
are
prepared
,
remember
doing
those
lock
down
drills
?
our
country
would
prepare
us
the
same
way
.
school
shootings
cause
far
less
deaths
then
if
schools
were
aloud
on
a
daily
bases
to
everyone
(
like
america
now
)
.
we
should
leave
guns
to
the
professionals
and
if
we
need
to
feel
safe
,
we
should
protect
ourselves
without
killing
someone
else
.
<new_line>
guns
do
nt
need
a
rule
book
,
people
need
to
be
trained
in
what
they
are
using
and
most
citizen
have
never
taken
a
gun
safety
course
.
people
do
have
rights
but
they
should
not
have
the
right
to
end
someones
life
because
they
were
scared
the
might
loose
their
own
,
and
that
s
the
self
defense
argument
.
if
you
wanna
feel
safe
there
are
so
many
less
barbaric
and
deadly
options
then
a
gun
.
we
are
humans
,
not
deer
.
if
you
pepper
spray
and
tase
an
intruder
,
what
more
can
they
do
?
they
ca
nt
see
or
move
...
so
they
ca
nt
shoot
you
and
they
are
still
alive
.
we
do
have
a
free
country
,
we
should
make
it
safe
too
.

-
 
its
traumatic
accidents
like
that
,
that
prove
why
using
guns
for
defense
,
is
dangerous
no
matter
what
.
if
that
man
had
just
tased
the
"
intruder
"
they
could
still
be
alive
and
happily
married
.
some
people
may
call
this
a
one
time
accident
,
but
people
think
of
guns
almost
by
default
as
necessary
to
self
-
defense
.
infact
all
of
the
people
"
for
"
gun
-
rights
used
that
idea
and
phrased
it
as
the
only
way
.
but
in
no
way
is
something
as
deadly
as
that
gun
,
the
only
way
.
our
school
is
a
gun
free
environment
,
or
better
phrased
,
has
gun
control
.
do
students
feel
safe
?
yes
,
because
guns
are
not
allowed
so
the
fear
of
being
shot
is
alot
less
.
could
a
gun
be
entered
into
a
school
?
yes
but
if
it
was
fired
,
we
have
designated
lockdown
drills
we
have
practiced
and
one
schools
shooting
kills
lots
less
then
if
we
were
to
have
guns
everyday
.
think
of
america
as
an
environment
with
guns
available
everyday
.
imagine
how
many
lives
would
be
taken
due
to
anger
or
other
temporary
emotional
disabilities
.
we
ca
nt
keep
amusing
the
worst
of
everyone
around
us
.
"
they
have
guns
,
so
we
need
guns
as
well
to
protect
ourselves
.
"
two
wrongs
like
in
that
statement
do
not
make
a
right
.
if
everyone
had
gun
control
,
we
d
have
a
"
school
"
type
of
environment
and
while
"
schools
shootings
"
or
gun
use
in
a
gun
-
controlled
setting
would
still
occur
,
its
much
,
much
less
then
if
we
were
all
having
guns
on
ourselves
as
"
defense
"
.
we
have
come
to
a
time
when
technology
and
idealisms
are
advancing
,
so
should
our
policy
on
gun
control
.
self
defense
should
just
keep
one
safe
,
not
kill
off
other
humans
.
innocent
ones
like
a
wife
to
be
,
or
a
robber
who
is
just
down
on
his
luck
.
they
are
fellow
humans
,
we
should
n't
even
get
the
change
to
flick
and
finger
and
fire
a
bullet
at
them
.
especially
when
something
as
common
as
pepper
spray
and
your
pet
rottweiler
could
keep
you
safer
.
<new_line>
that
person
does
not
look
crazy
at
all
,
he
appears
to
be
a
person
who
happens
to
like
guns
and
is
responsible
enough
to
go
to
a
shooting
range
.
by
taking
away
guns
from
the
average
citizen
you
are
only
allowing
the
criminals
easy
access
seeing
as
they
will
not
give
up
their
guns
.
<new_line>
so
your
argument
against
people
owning
guns
is
that
since
some
people
might
make
stupid
mistakes
then
it
is
okay
to
punish
everyone
?
with
that
logic
we
might
as
well
ban
cars
because
some
people
will
get
in
wrecks
from
being
bad
drivers
,
ban
alcohol
because
some
people
drink
too
much
,
and
ban
kitchen
utensils
because
some
people
stab
themselves
.
<new_line>
right
to
bear
arms-
second
amendment
of
the
constitution
.
weapons
are
used
for
many
reasons
these
days
.
some
use
weapons
for
sport
some
use
them
for
looks
some
use
them
for
fun
.
although
some
people
have
killed
people
with
guns
also
we
should
nt
take
our
constitutional
rights
away
do
to
a
few
mentally
psychotic
or
duranged
people
<new_line>
"
guns
kill
people
"
that
is
wat
we
have
to
remember
.
i
mean
noone
should
have
a
gun
.
that
enforces
that
people
kill
one
anouther
.
<new_line>
guns
play
a
huge
role
in
intimidation
as
well
.
if
i
am
strapped
for
cash
and
decide
that
the
only
way
to
make
any
money
would
be
to
rob
somebody
,
i
think
i
'd
rather
rob
a
store
without
a
gun
than
a
store
with
a
gun
.
they
can
be
used
for
bad
things
,
but
legal
guns
are
typically
used
for
good
or
for
protection
from
illegal
guns
.
<new_line>
guns
rights
is
in
a
pretty
good
position
right
now
.
you
can
own
a
gun
,
if
proven
trustworthy
.
this
is
not
the
case
in
all
states
,
but
it
is
in
most
.
some
argue
that
it
is
dangerous
to
be
giving
out
guns
,
but
with
guns
-
rights
or
no
gun
-
rights
criminals
will
still
have
guns
.
however
,
the
average
person
who
wants
to
own
a
gun
for
self
-
defense
will
be
prohibited
to
without
guns
-
rights
.
meanwhile
,
with
gun
-
rights
the
average
person
can
own
a
gun
and
protect
himself
against
criminals
.
<new_line>
although
i
'm
against
guns
,
what
you
are
saying
is
absolutely
correct.as
far
as
americas
majority
of
people
who
do
want
gun
rights
,
they
are
in
a
pretty
good
position.as
i
said
in
my
first
argument
,
my
husband
is
all
for
guns
and
is
one
of
those
affected
by
australia
's
recent
gun
laws
.
my
hubby
"
wishes
he
had
your
gun
rights
america
,
so
be
grateful"
....
personally
i
think
its
the
reason
behind
half
your
problems
...
however
my
hubby,(in
this
moment
i
am
typing
)
just
rebutted
me
by
saying
that
in
switzerland
,
they
encourage
,
that
all
their
citizens
have
a
gun
.
<new_line>
guns
are
bad
period
.
do
nt
assume
that
"
the
upperclass
"
are
any
less
capable
of
using
them
in
a
corrupted
fashion.remember
human
nature
is
human
nature
.
no
-
one
is
exempt
from
human
nature.time
has
proved
again
and
again
anyone
is
capable
of
snapping
.
<new_line>
we
have
to
look
outside
the
box
.
criminals
will
absolutley
get
a
hold
of
guns
whether
there
is
a
law
banning
firearms
or
not
.
if
you
do
n't
believe
in
guns
,
then
do
n't
buy
a
damn
gun
.
if
you
feel
safe
in
your
home
without
a
gun
,
then
do
n't
buy
a
damn
gun
.
if
you
feel
safe
walking
amongst
thieves
and
murderers
with
just
a
can
of
pepper
spray
,
then
....
say
it
with
it
me
.....
don't
buy
a
damn
gun
.
me
?
i
like
the
idea
that
if
i
have
the
choice
,
i
could
lethally
defend
me
or
a
loved
one
.
i
do
n't
know
about
you
,
but
i
live
outside
the
box
.
on
the
outside
we
do
n't
live
in
a
perfect
world
where
there
is
n't
crime
and
violence
.
i
'm
not
a
trigger
happy
fellow
either
as
you
might
paint
us
gun
rights
enthusiasts
.
i
dread
the
thought
of
the
day
i
might
have
to
take
the
life
of
another
human
being
.
you
know
what
though?
.....
it
could
be
mine
that
's
taken
from
me
if
i
fail
to
protect
myself
.
if
everyone
carried
a
firearm
on
them
,
everywhere
they
went
.....
you
think
home
invasions
,
theft
or
murders
would
occur
quite
as
often
?
i
do
n't
believe
so
.
half
the
scum
bags
would
be
dead
.
take
away
our
weapons
....
and
you
give
criminals
the
chance
to
flourish
.
<new_line>
you
should
n't
use
your
schools
"
gun
-
free
enviroment
"
as
an
argument
.
it
does
n't
hold
much
weight
.
when
i
was
in
school
...
do
you
know
how
many
drug
deals
i
saw
take
place
in
my
school
(
and
took
place
in
...
-snicker-
)
?
did
you
also
know
my
school
was
(
still
is
)
a
drug
-
free
enviroment
?
it
's
quite
amusing
actually
.....
what
comforts
people
's
minds
.
it
's
the
simple
things
.
you
can
paint
the
world
whatever
color
you
want
.
it
's
still
a
cruel
world
.
it
's
still
full
of
thieves
and
murderers
.
you
can
make
yourself
as
vulnerable
as
you
want
.
i
'll
make
myself
as
protected
as
i
can
.
<new_line>
ohhhhhblooodyhell
,
hours
later
me
and
me
hubby
are
still
debating
this
and
its
really
starting
to
shit
me
....
he
is
really
starting
to
change
my
mind
...
someone
please
gimme
a
gun
...
;)
<new_line>
first
of
all
its
not
in
the
constitution
itself
,
its
simply
an
amendment
,
i
think
you
should
read
about
what
your
talking
about
before
you
go
and
time
up
and
argument
on
it
.
here
is
the
a
the
direct
quote
a
well
regulated
militia
,
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
,
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
,
shall
not
be
infringed
.
in
oder
for
the
state
to
be
secure
we
can
not
have
deadly
weapons
used
for
looks
like
they
are
some
new
type
of
hot
wheels
made
for
fun
and
looks
.
your
constitutional
right
is
to
keep
and
bare
arms
,
not
guns
,
and
for
the
safety
of
the
state
and
all
in
it
we
need
to
take
away
simple
dangers
for
citizens
,
cause
eventually
we
need
to
stop
playing
with
hot
wheels
and
grow
up
.
<new_line>
this
is
a
high
school
debate
,
for
a
history
class
,
anyone
not
in
it
like
yourself
is
banned
and
anyone
else
floating
in
here
and
reading
this
do
n't
bother
typing
you
are
not
a
high
school
student
and
need
to
find
something
else
to
busy
yourself
with
that
interrupting
out
education
activity
.
thank
you
<new_line>
i
recommend
you
get
sober
or
take
a
happy
pill
and
stop
debating
with
high
schoolers
who
can
form
better
thoughts
then
you
.
<new_line>
ok
then
.
so
do
cars
,
trains
,
boats
,
planes
,
stoves
,
showers
,
bathtubs
,
....
uh
wait
a
sec
...
did
you
mean
that
people
can
use
guns
to
kill
people
?
my
bad
!
<new_line>
do
you
mean
a
gun
should
not
be
the
fall
back
defensive
?
?
?
the
gun
is
a
weapon
made
for
the
peasents
,
for
those
soldiers
who
could
nt
take
years
to
train
.
of
all
the
other
weapons
in
the
world
the
gun
is
the
most
efficient
for
self
defense
,
taking
little
training
and
thought
to
use
.
are
you
saying
a
knife
would
work
better
when
the
majority
of
americans
do
nt
even
know
how
to
use
a
knife
?
?
?
they
would
end
up
cutting
themselves
let
alone
their
assaulters
.
if
one
had
a
gun
,
a
single
warning
shot
in
the
air
will
make
them
run
before
the
need
of
killing
.
however
one
still
needs
to
have
the
killing
intent
or
they
will
be
attacked
and
be
in
a
tausle
for
the
gun
.
<new_line>
if
you
need
to
take
the
"
time
to
find
your
gun
if
you
are
taken
hostage
"
i
surely
hope
you
do
not
have
a
gun
and
more
importantly
have
anyone
who
would
do
something
bad
if
they
found
it
.
<new_line>
it
's
not
that
hard
to
learn
how
to
use
a
gun
.
i
'm
15
,
and
in
just
3
hours
,
when
i
was
12
years
old
,
i
learned
how
to
safely
use
a
rifle
,
pistol
,
and
shotgun
.
why
can
we
trust
the
people
like
us
in
the
military
with
automatic
weapons
,
tanks
,
and
explosives
to
defend
our
own
country
but
we
ca
n't
trust
ourselves
to
defend
our
own
lives
?
i
do
,
however
,
agree
with
the
fact
anyone
willing
to
buy
a
gun
should
take
some
kind
of
safety
course
or
such
,
and
we
should
make
it
a
law
.
<new_line>
even
if
guns
were
banned
,
things
would
n't
really
be
much
safer
.
the
people
committing
gun
crimes
are
usually
not
getting
them
legitimately
in
the
first
place
.
people
can
not
be
expected
to
"
move
"
every
time
they
perceive
a
potential
threat
.
banning
guns
is
not
the
answer
.
<new_line>
guns
serve
a
useful
purpose
in
self
defense
because
they
reduce
the
amount
of
money
and
strain
on
the
court
system
to
imprison
the
offender
.
dead
people
ca
n't
waste
government
resources
.
<new_line>
can
you
please
give
me
a
link
to
where
you
found
your
statistics
?
they
are
so
interesting
i
somewhat
doubt
them
(
no
offense
.
)
by
the
way
,
modern
warfare
2
teaches
tactics
.
<new_line>
i
bet
the
people
against
guns
are
for
the
killing
of
babies
...
<new_line>
edit
:
sorry
,
i
just
seen
the
note
on
this
debate
.
i
'm
not
part
of
the
class
you
speak
of
.
i
understand
if
you
wish
to
delete
this
response
.
this
was
a
hard
one
for
me
.
i
own
a
gun
...
lol
.
and
i
still
think
people
should
be
allowed
to
have
a
gun
.
yet
,
i
do
n't
think
people
really
have
the
"
right
"
to
own
one
.
not
according
to
the
constitution
.
"
a
well
regulated
militia
,
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
,
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
,
shall
not
be
infringed
.
"
most
people
are
not
a
part
of
the
militia
...
lol
.
not
unless
you
are
in
the
national
guard
.
even
if
you
stretched
the
meaning
to
include
those
that
could
be
drafted
into
the
national
guard
during
an
emergency
you
still
would
be
cutting
out
a
huge
chunk
of
the
population
.
women
would
probably
be
excluded
as
well
as
those
men
under
and
over
a
certain
age
limit
.
so
,
do
i
think
people
should
be
allowed
to
have
guns
?
yes
.
do
i
think
everyone
has
the
right
...
or
should
be
given
the
right
?
no
.
<new_line>
the
centers
for

control

has
a
startling
revelation
for

.
it
is
projected
that
deaths
from
guns
will
surpass
deaths
from
car
fatalities
in
2015
.
an
estimated
33,000
americans
will
lose

from

as
opposed
to
an

32,000

who

really
get
how
this
is
an
answer
,
but
yes
...
we
should
"
should
you
carry
a
gun
"
.
i
mean
,
if
you
do
n't
want
to
,
go
ahead
,
but
it
just
makes
things
much
easier
if
everyone
carried
a
gun
.
humans
would
react
to
each
other
much
differently
and
burglaries
would
most
likely
be
less
.
i
like
guns
,
and
i
will
do
my
part
in
eliminating
the
criminal
world
by
enacting
my
castle
doctrine
rights
whenever
necessary
.
plus
,
if
ever
necessary
,
we
have
a
revolution
to
get
ready
for
.
basically
,
we
fight
once
they
try
to
take
away
our
guns
.
and
there
's
stuff
like
fighting
invading
terrorists
,
shit
like
that
.
<new_line>
i
would
not
carry
a
gun
because
they
are
very
dangerous
also
i
do
n't
want
to
be
wanted
for
killing
people
and
people
saying
i
have
one
or
most
important
i
do
n't
want
to
load
it
wrong
and
kill
my
self
<new_line>
the
government
should
not
have
the
power
to
take
away
our
guns--
if
you
want
to
carry
a
gun
,
you
have
the
right
to
do
so
.
<new_line>
we
should
not
be
allowed
to
carry
guns
,
because
of
the
gangsters
and
others
who
shoot
at
will
,
the
13
-
15
year
olds
who
fight
with
steel
rods
would
exchange
their
weapons
with
guns
,
and
those
who
are
mentally
ill
would
carry
guns
too
.
<new_line>
should
you
carry
guns
?
fuck
no
.
not
in
usa
or
uk
anyway
-
culture
plays
a
huge
part
in
the
abuse
of
guns
.
this
is
n't
a
question
about
rights
-
it
's
whether
it
's
right
or
not
right
.
guns
are
created
for
one
purpose
-
to
harm
.
to
kill
.
whether
you
use
it
in
defence
or
attack
it
serves
on
purpose
.
there
's
more
than
one
way
to
attack
and
there
's
more
than
one
way
to
defend
.
guns
should
n't
be
in
either
option
.
idiots
argue
that
if
somebody
invades
your
home
with
a
gun
then
you
need
one
.
guns
would
be
made
so
difficult
to
acquire
that
guns
would
be
used
so
rarely
that
nobody
(
or
rarely
)
would
bring
it
to
rob
a
home
.
<new_line>
"
not
in
usa
or
uk
anyway"---ok
we
give
india
all
the
guns
then
?
yeh
you
would
like
that
would
nt
you
?
do
nt
worry
the
world
is
giving
in
to
all
of
indias
demands
kinda
.
you
do
nt
need
to
to
take
our
guns
,
just
ask
,
we
will
give
you
cunts
them
too
no
doubt
.
<new_line>
well
actually
i
was
referring
to
finland
or
switzerland
who
have
high
numbers
of
gun
ownership
and
low
numbers
of
gun
crime
.
you
would
n't
know
though
.
fuckface
.
<new_line>
noone
,
should
carry
a
gun
.
there
could
be
accidental
crimes
,
like
you
could
kill
people
by
mistake
,
of
sudden
emotion
,
.
if
we
really
need
to
carry
a
gun
,
it
should
be
non
-
life
taking
guns
such
as
gas
guns
in
case
we
face
dangerous
situations
.
real
guns
are
too
bloody
.
<new_line>
if
everyone
carried
a
gun
people
would
get
mad
and
start
shooting
people
and
everything
would
be
a
pile
of
blood
and
guts
i
like
guns
but
the
world
would
be
a
big
disaster
if
everyone
carried
a
gun
.
<new_line>
you
ca
n't
kill
someone
by
mistake
you
have
to
make
a
decision
to
point
the
gun
and
pull
the
trigger
.
<new_line>
do
you
carry
car
keys
or
a
cellular
phone
around
with
you
?
how
about
a
belt
?
i
know
how
to
kill
people
very
easily
with
all
three
of
those
items
.
i
'm
sure
if
someone
was
intent
on
killing
a
person
,
they
could
learn
how
to
kill
with
those
items
as
well
.
but
i
have
never
killed
anyone
though
,
and
i
never
intend
to
.
what
it
really
boils
down
to
is
that
a
gun
is
only
a
tool
.
if
someone
is
deranged
enough
to
start
killing
innocent
people
,
it
wo
n't
really
matter
whether
they
can
have
a
gun
or
not
,
they
will
simply
use
another
tool
.
and
since
there
are
n't
mass
murderings
on
a
regular
basis
(
in
civilized
countries
anyways
)
it
's
fairly
safe
to
assume
that
there
are
n't
very
many
homicidal
maniacs
out
there
.
<new_line>
remember
a
disarmed
people
is
a
obedient
group
of
people

<new_line>
it
is
best
not
to
carry
a
gun
.
it
is
now
2015
and
there
is
too
much

violence
in
america
.
<new_line>
the

<new_line>
gun
control
means
that
you
should
use
both
hands
when
you
fire
your
gun
;)
<new_line>
the
2nd
amendment
states
that
we
can
bear
arms
to
protect
ourselves.if
that
is
changed
then
what
would
i
do
with
my
desert
eagle
<new_line>
i
think
people
should
be
able
to
carry
guns
for
many
reasons
.
i
think
that
because
most
cities
and
neighborhoods
are
very
dangerous
.
so
if
you
were
just
at
a
red
light
or
somthing
then
somebody
runs
up
on
you
and
tries
to
car
jack
you
or
watever
with
a
gun
you
should
be
able
to
have
a
gun
and
atleast
shoot
that
person
in
the
arm
or
somthing
so
that
you
wo
n't
get
killed
.
that
way
if
you
shoot
them
in
the
arm
they
would
probably
,
well
they
should
have
a
chance
to
live
but
if
they
shoot
you
in
the
head
or
chest
you
might
die
because
that
is
more
severe
.
it
is
very
dangerous
around
here
and
people
need
to
protect
theirselves
.
<new_line>
i
do
n't
think
that
should
have
guns
because
if
a
really
dumb
desperate
drug
attic
really
wanted
some
drugs
or
money
they
would
definately
buy
a
gun,(or
steal
it
)
and
find
some
houses
to
break
into
then
try
and
find
money
.
if
they
see
somebody
in
that
house
then
they
would
definatley
shoot
them
cold
-
blooded
.
then
they
would
keep
the
pursuit
and
kill
many
other
people
.
that
is
if
they
do
not
get
caught
.
<new_line>
if
there
is
gun
control
there
would
be
less
crime.drug
lords
will
not
be
able
to
sell
drugs
.
there
will
be
less
people
in
jail
for
murder
.they
can
still
use
knives
though
.
<new_line>
some
people
should
not
shoot
guns.they
do
n't
even
know
how
to
keep
the
gun
from
smashing
there
face
in
.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5zlwvujpaa
<new_line>
the
nra
says
that
we
should
have
guns.they
pay
a
lot
of
money
to
keep
guns
around.if
there
is
gun
control
they
will
have
no
busines.i
support
the
nra
to
keep
them
in
business
and
to
keep
gun
around
.
<new_line>
people
in
the
army
need
guns
to
protect
themselves.if
they
did
not
have
guns
in
the
military
,
we
would
suck
.
all
of
our
troops
would
be
dead.without
rocket
launchers
we
would
be
bombed
.
<new_line>
i
also
think
that
we
should
have
guns
because
if
the
police
does
n't
have
any
weapons
or
anything
for
defence
then
all
the
criminals
would
get
away
.
!
it
would
be
ore
dangerous
without
guns
than
it
is
if
we
did
not
have
guns
.
<new_line>
some
reasons
why
we
should
n't
have
guns
is
because
if
we
did
n't
then
many
other
kids
would
not
be
exposed
to
to
the
guns
and
that
way
if
the
guns
are
gone
then
the
children
wo
n't
shoot
their
selves
or
each
other
.
because
if
a
parent
has
a
gun
in
the
house
and
the
child
see
's
where
the
parent
put
it
they
are
going
to
want
and
invite
their
=
little
friends
over
and
wanting
to
show
them
.
so
when
he
/
she
shows
their
friends
they
might
get
shot
or
shoot
them
by
accident
.
or
even
on
purpose
.
<new_line>
we
should
n't
have
guns
because
it
kills
many
people
in
the
world
.
it
is
very
violent
and
many
people
loose
their
lives
using
them
.
also
they
get
locked
up
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
if
they
shoot
,
kill
,
or
even
not
have
a
liscense
for
it
.
<new_line>
if
there
was
no
guns
in
the
world
there
would
be
know
war
...
maybe.guns
cause
violence
and
destruction.we
even
bimbed
china
during
the
war.maybe
they
deserved
it
.
<new_line>
well
,
in
switzerland
everyone
has
full
auto
assault
weapons
and
there
is
almost
no
crime
.
in
mexico
,
almost
everything
is
illegal
and
just
look
at
their
murder
rates
.
in
my
opinion
,
crime
is
caused
by
poverty
and
drug
addiction
,
not
guns
.
if
we
get
rid
of
poverty
and
drugs
,
there
will
be
no
more
problem
.
gun
control
just
makes
it
worse
because
criminals
can
still
buy
their
guns
illegally
but
responsible
citizens
ca
n't
and
are
totally
defenseless
.
also
,
if
the
guns
are
gone
,
it
makes
it
easier
for
people
like
hitler
to
take
control
over
the
government
and
genocide
people
.
nowadays
people
just
think
the
cops
will
protect
them
,
but
what
if
they
go
away
or
become
bad
.
i
call
people
with
that
mentality
,
"
sheep
"
.
<new_line>
but
gun
control
wo
n't
get
rid
of
the
guns
.
does
prohibition
get
rid
of
drugs
?
even
if
we
do
eradicate
them
,
people
will
just
use
some
other
efficient
device
like
nukes
to
mass
murder
eachother
<new_line>
do
you
know
that
when
criminals
who
had
been
arrested
for
breaking
and
entering
were
asked
if
they
were
afraid
of
homeowners
with
guns
,
the
majority
of
the
criminals
responded
no
?
the
criminals
were
n't
afraid
because
they
all
believed
that
if
they
were
ever
confronted
by
a
gun
wielding
homeowner
,
the
normal
law
-
abiding
citizen
would
hesitate
while
the
criminals
would
pull
their
own
guns
and
shoot
first
.
people
constantly
trumpet
about
how
having
a
gun
means
that
they
can
protect
themselves
,
but
first
they
must
be
able
to
fire
the
gun
on
another
human
being
,
something
that
most
people
find
hard
to
do
.
really
protecting
yourself
with
a
gun
is
n't
very
much
protection
at
all
,
meanwhile
the
abundance
and
attainability
of
guns
means
dangerous
people
can
easily
get
a
hold
of
a
dangerous
weapon
.
<new_line>
it
's
not
about
removing
guns
completely
its
about
making
gun
control
laws
more
stringent
so
that
tragedies
like
the
recent
one
in
arizona
are
avoided
.
if
people
were
n't
allowed
to
simply
walk
into
a
gun
show
and
purchase
a
weapon
with
no
background
check
,
if
people
were
required
to
have
a
license
it
becomes
more
difficult
for
criminals
and
for
people
who
intend
to
misuse
their
guns
,
to
acquire
them
,
while
still
allowing
for
law
abiding
citizens
to
own
and
buy
guns
.
<new_line>
that
could
have
been
because
1
)
they
were
on
drugs
at
the
time
,
and
did
n't
have
their
senses
with
them
2
)
most
homeowner
do
n't
have
guns
anymore
3
)
they
were
scared
shitless
,
but
they
did
n't
admit
it
because
it
would
make
them
look
like
a
pansy
.
there
could
be
many
more
reasons
other
than
:
 
in
fact
,
most
armed
homeowners
,
when
faced
with
an
intruder
,
are
able
to
kill
it
or
hold
it
for
police
without
much
trouble
because
they
are
far
better
oriented
with
their
home
than
the
intruder
.
they
also
have
much
better
mental
faculties
.
 
not
when
it
's
a
life
or
death
situation
.
you
ca
n't
know
until
you
've
been
in
one
.
 
the
abundance
and
attainability
of
weapons
also
work
to
the
advantage
of
the
law
abider
.
you
have
much
better
chances
when
you
can
defend
yourself
.

the

some

advocates
argue

<new_line>
why
should
the

punish
us
the
law
abiding
citizens
of
america
for
what
some
people
have
done
and
plus
what
happens
if
someone
with

breaks
into
your

and
you
do
n't
have
any
becuase
it

<new_line>
i
am
all
for
gun
control
.
in
my
mind
,
gun
control
means
hitting
your
target
.
this

is
n't
truly
up
for
debate
since
the
2nd
amendment
binds
the
hands
of
the
leviathan
that
the

has
become

gun
control
most
certainly
worked
for
hitler
,
mao
,
stalin
and
pol
pot
.
mass
murderers
of
their

love
gun
control
.
read
the

,
the
federalist
and
anti

and
realize
why
patrick

such
simple

individuals
who
have
no

training
,
no

experience
with

and
have
not
had
a

i
gather
when
federal
law
allowed
slavery
,
that
was
ok
?
the
constitution
was
written
on
a
then
8th
grade
reading
level
and
does
n't
require
a
law
degree
to
interpret
.
considering
this
nation
is
moving
at
a
rapid
pace
towards
that
depicted
in
the
movie
idiocracy
,
i
can
understand
your
inability
to
read
and
interpret
a
simple
document
that
was
written
to
make
you
a
free
person

if
you

<new_line>
gun

advocates
argue
that
they
curb

by
criminals
,

,
and
other
"
high

"
individuals
.
they
contend
that
only
federal
measures
can
successfully
reduce
the

of

some
seek
broad
policy
changes
such
as
near
-
prohibition
of
non

handgun
ownership
or
the
registration
of
all
firearm
owners
or
firearms
.
they
assert
that
there
is
no
constitutional
barrier
to
such
measures
and
no
significant
social
costs
.
others
advocate
less
comprehensive
policies
that
they
maintain
would
not
impede
ownership
and
legitimate
firearm
transfers
.
<new_line>
the
two
most
significant
federal
statutes
controlling
firearms
in
the
civilian
population
are
the
national
firearms
act
of
1934
and
the
gun
control
act
of
1968.the
1934
act
established
strict
registration
requirements
and
a
transfer
tax
on
machine
guns
and
short
-
barreled
long
guns
.
the
1968
act
prohibits
mail
-
order
sales
and
the
interstate
sales
of
firearms
,
prohibits
transfers
to
minors
,
limits
access
to
"
new
"
assault
weapons
,
and
sets
forth
penalties
and
licensing
requirements
for
manufacturers
,
importers
,

this

although
the
public
generally
perceives
medical
research
as
the
highest
order
of
precision
,
much
of
the
epidemiologic

is
,
in
fact
,
rather
imprecise
and
understandably
so
because
it
has
been
conducted
principally
by
individuals

consequently

they

awful

<new_line>
sure
,
america
is
obsessed
with
right

bear

,
what
does
that
really

does
it

that
i
have
the

well
,
the

thinks
no

yes

if

there

<new_line>
the
right
to
bear

declared
by
the
seccond

is
not
what
you
think
.
it
actualy
reffers
to
the
old
militia
of
the
states
right
to
bear
arms
in
a
civilian
atmosphere
.
when
the

declared
the
civilian
right
to

thought
of
today
,
crime
rates
drop
little
more
than
2
%
,
but
in

,
crime

increased

almost

worse

<new_line>
no
it

it

we

,
they
're
called

national

they
did
n't
have
those
in

back

they
also
used
muskets
back
then
,
not
semi

automatics
that
can
kill
literally
dozens
of

in

so
the
times
have
changed

are
completely
brain
washed

they
've
let
the
nra
convince
them
they
are
safer
if
they
carry
a

.
that
's
ridiculous
.
more
people
die
in
accidental
shootings
than
in
purposeful
ones
.
as
for
"
well
criminals
will
still
get
guns
.
"
that
's
a
logical
fallacy
when
applied
to
whether
they

you

if

they

instead

companies
when
it
is

mess

and
you
would
be
amazed
how
quickly
criminals
wo
n't
be

.
all
of
that
said
,
i
have
no
problem
with
pobunk

allowing

to
have
hunting

.
however
,
the
people
of
pobunk
missouri
(
and
the

)
should
not
be
allowed
to
say
that
every
gangbanger
in
s.
chicago
should
be
allowed
to
pick
up
a
gun
at
the
corner
store
simply
because
in
the
1700
's
the
founders
were
n't
fortune
tellers
and
did
n't
know
how
far
the
technology
would
go
with

i
love
how
gun
sellers
have
convinced
people
that
live
somewhere
else
entirely
that
they
need
to
get
all
crazy
when
the

in

are

for

abiding
people
the

check
are
a
must
but
armed
citizens
help
save
lives
<new_line>
some
weapons
are
not
necessary
for
a
civilian
.
a
machine
gun
is
not
necessary
for
a
civilian
.
perhaps
a
pistol
.
regardless
,
i
would
not
feel
safer
seeing
everyone
walking
around
with
a
knife
or
a
gun
.
the
compulsion
to
use
that
weapon
would
be
too
great
.
if
you
disrespect
someone
who
is
carrying
that
pistol
,
prepare
to
have
a
bullet
wound
or
a
stabbing
.
basically
by
giving
all
people
the
choice
of
carrying
around
weapons
,
you
give
them
the
power
to
hurt
others
.
a
civilized
society
can
not
function
when
there
is
senseless
violence
.
i
can
see
that
giving
people
the
right
to
have
a
weapon
is
important
for
protection
.
but
certain
weapons
are
not
necessary
for
safety
.
one
does
n't
need
a
bazooka
to
be
safe
,
nor
a
machine
gun
,
nor
a
chain
gun
,
nor
a
sniper
rifle
.
these
are
superfluous
to
safety
.
presenting
such
weapons
as
protective
is
misleading
.
additionally
,
civilians
should
not
be
allowed
to
carry
potentially
aggressive
weaponry
in
public
.
defensive
weaponry
would
be
a
better
choice
,
e.g.
mace
.
<new_line>
all
forms
of
weapons
are
illegal
in
japan
,
and
they
have
an
extremely
peaceful
society
.
<new_line>
in
switzerland
it
is
common
policy
that
the
citizens
are
equipped
with
and
trained
in
firearms
,
they
too
are
peaceful
.
if
you
look
at
the
big
picture
,
violence
in
a
society
does
n't
reliably
correlate
with
gun
control
.
i
would
argue
that
it
's
a
combination
of
cultural
values
and
corruption
(
like
poverty
,
citizen
's
rights
,
etc
.
)
.
<new_line>
china
,
south
africa
,
and
russia
have
strict
laws
regarding
weapons
and
they
are
not
peaceful
.
<new_line>
jumping
from
buildings
or
bridges
is
a
common
suicide
method
in
japan
.
however
,
my
original
statement
is
not
only
my
personal
opinion
,
but
also
the
opinion
of
one
of
america
's
leading
criminal
psychologists
.
<new_line>
   
it
was
n't
an
opinion
,
it
was
a
statement
of
two
facts
that
do
not
correlate
.
for
example
:
france
has
some
of
the
world
's
finest
wines
,
it
is
also
recently
very
culturally
diverse
.
gun
laws
do
n't
make
a
peaceful
society
.
just
recently
a
shooting
spree
occurred
in
the
uk
,
which
has
stringent
gun
laws
,
and
the
weapon
was
licensed
.
<new_line>
what
'
was
n't
an
option
'
?
robert
k.
ressler
-
a
prominent
american
criminal
psychologist
-
wrote
in
one
of
his
books
that
japan
has
a
very
peaceful
society
,
which
is
caused
by
their
lack
of
weaponry
.
he
then
contrasted
japan
to
america
,
a
ruthless
and
excessively
violent
nation
that
terrifies
the
japanese
people
.
<new_line>
opinion
.
what
you
wrote
were
two
fact
-
sentences
.
an
opinion
reads
like
"
i
think
"
or
"
i
feel
"
etc
.
 
they
can
be
wrong
you
know
,
but
going
on
...
 
judging
him
by
what
you
wrote
,
he
sounds
either
inept
or
political
.
there
are
many
countries
out
there
with
differing
levels
of
gun
control
.
of
the
stringent
countries
,
some
like
brazil
still
have
high
amounts
of
gun
violence
,
others
like
japan
do
not
.
of
the
laxer
countries
,
switzerland
is
very
safe
but
the
us
has
high
amounts
of
gun
crime
.
in
spite
of
this
inconsistency
,
gun
laws
are
often
pushed
for
out
of
fear
rather
than
rationality
.
people
look
for
things
to
blame
,
and
are
n't
satisfied
as
much
with
abstract
concepts
like
income
disparity
,
inequality
,
they
would
rather
blame
an
object
.
<new_line>
how
about
those
of
us
who
enjoy
weapons
for
recreational
purposes

it
's
pretty

rifle

my
sentiments
exactly
when
you
say
that
paranormal
phenomena
is

but
you
will
not

do
i
detect
a
hint
of
hypocrisy
here
?
 
as
can
all
those

you

love

quote
.
 
he
wrote
that

fifteen
years

perhaps
things
have
changed

<new_line>
the
second
amendment
was
n't
to
give
permission
for
recreational
gun
usage
.
it
was
for
protection
.
i
only
see
weapons
as
justifiable
insofar
as
they
are
reasonable
protection
.
<new_line>
   
it
is
also
about
ownership
.
one
of
the
sections
mentions
a
militia
,
but
the
other
specifies
ownership
,
and
i
do
n't
believe
that
it
was
written
in
the
spirit
of
limited
utility
,
but
as
a
general
right
.
besides
,
how
do
you
expect
to
get
good
enough
at
shooting
if
not
recreationally
?
<new_line>
not
opinion
,
more
like
scientific
consensus
.
 
i
do
n't
quote

i
do
n't

so
,
gun

has
existed
since
the

all

problem

<new_line>
“
laws

disarm
only
those

neither

such

make

they

”
(
quoting
cesare
beccaria
)
<new_line>
it
seems
most
people
have
this
fantasy
about
shooting
somebody
breaking
into
their
house
in
the
middle
of
the
night
.
statistically
,
it
's
far
more
likely
that
they
or
a
member
of
their
family
,
especially
their
own
children
will
die
as
a
result
of
there
being
a
gun
in
the
home
,
not
some
street
hood
intruding
on
their
castle
.
the
classic
argument
is
that
"
criminals
do
n't
care
about
gun
bans
,
so
a
gun
ban
only
takes
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
law
abiding
citizens
"

i

i

not

that
there
are
close
to
300
million
legally
owned
firearms
in

.
with

full
of
guns
on

where
do
you
think
criminals
get
them
from
?
<new_line>
that
's
true
,
but
what
people
are
n't
told
is
that
the
number
of
deaths
are
just
below
50

a
natural
response
would
be
more
gun
regulation
is
going
to
help
,
but
people
need
to
look
at
the
facts
rather
than
just
ideology
.
think
about
it
:
if
you
were
a
madman
and
you
wanted
to
kill
as
many
people
as
possible
,
would
you
rather
go
to
a
gun
-
free
area
or
an
area
where
most
people
are
carrying
guns
.
gun
regulation
is
based
upon
the
misled
knowledge
that
if
you
give
a
gun
to
the
average
person
,
they
will
go
about
trying
to
kill
as
many
people
as
possible
,
but
in
actual
fact
the
average
person
is
relatively
good
and
sane
enough
not
to
do
that
.
the
government
can
stop
law
abiding
citizens
from
protecting
themselves
,
but
they
can
never
prevent
criminals
from
doing
so
.
what
really
kills
,
the
gun
or
the
person
carrying
it
?
<new_line>
i
do
n't
have
an
issue
with
hunting
rifles
(
300
,
306
etc
)
,
even
handguns
are
probably
ok
.
my
question
is
why
would
anybody
need
to
own
an
m-16
or
an
ak-47
?
i
was
at
a
gun
shop
last
week
that
had
an
assault
rifle
on
sale
with
a
fucking
gernade
launcher
attached
to
it
.
"
well
,
you
ca
n't
buy
the
gernades
legally
.
"
then
why
the
fuck
is
it
on
there
?
i
'm
pretty
sure
when
our
forefathers
wrote
the
right
to
bear
arms
in
the
constitution
they
were
n't
envisioning
the
assualt
rifle
.
<new_line>
so
people
should
n't
have
the
capacity
to
defend
themselves
?
 
well
,
as
a
child
raised
by
ex
-
criminals
on
both
sides
of
my
family
i
can
tell
you
that
we
would
never
purchase
guns
from
the
store
or
pawn
shops
.
the
best
way
to
acquire
guns
is
via
yard
sales
,
or
have
a
person
buy
the
gun
for
you
,
that
way
your
name
does
n't
show
on
the
paper
work
.
seriously
,
who
is
stupid
enough
to
follow
gun
regulations
at
face
value
and
get
their
name
attached
to
a
model
of
firearm
?
that
's
just
asking
for
trouble
.
did
i
mention
black
market
arms
dealers
?
they
are
n't
that
hard
to
find
.
also
,
why
in
god
's
name
would
you
steal
a
gun
from
an
armed
house
?
that
's
the
riskiest
thing
to
do
,
because
you
need
to
know
where
it
's
hidden
and
you
always
risk
being
caught
in
the
process
by
the
armed
owner
.
<new_line>
many
people
feel
this
way
.
 
simple
answer
,
really
.
fun
.
why
did
i
build
a
flamethrower
when
i
was
a
kid
in
school
?
why
do
young
boys
make
pipe
bombs
and
enjoy
firecrackers
?
it
's
fun
.
lighting
things
on
fire
and
blowing
stuff
up
is
fun
,
and
having
powerful
guns
is
especially
so
.
 
because
some
of
us
are
drawn
to
big
weapons
and
would
like
to
see
one
,
and
on
the
down
low
you
can
make
grenades
or
buy
them
and
launch
them
in
no
-
man
's
land
.
what
ever
happened
to
just
accepting
that
some
of
us
like
to
shoot
things
,
blow
things
up
,
etc
?
it
's
good
,
clean
fun
and
nobody
is
hurt
from
it
.
culture
of
fear
maybe
?
<new_line>
with
a
gun
?
no
.
 
i
see
,
so
banning
guns
just
stops
law
abiding
citizens
from
having
them
,
yet
your
family
of
criminals
buys
them
from
people
who
legally
obtained
them
,
or
has
them
legally
obtained
for
them
.
that
makes
sense
.
 
why
?
i
do
n't
know
,
ask
some
of
the
people
who
stole
1.7
million
guns
between
1993
and
2002
.
is
it
really
that
difficult
to
case
a
house
for
a
couple
days
and
figure
out
when
somebody
's
at
work
?
i
do
n't
even
come
from
a
family
of
criminals
and
i
'm
sure
i
'd
have
no
problem
doing
this
.
<new_line>
because
...
?
it
's
scary
to
you
?
 
laws
change
through
the
years
,
but
stockpiles
of
firearms
are
decades
old
.
you
buy
what
existed
before
the
laws
came
into
effect
.
it
's
obvious
stuff
.
of
course
,
you
can
still
believe
that
banning
guns
or
imposing
stiff
regulations
on
them
will
make
them
vanish
,
if
that
makes
you
happy
or
comfortable
.
it
's
not
true
,
however
.
 
so
less
than
1
%
of
your
300
million
firearms
are
stolen
,
this
must
be
the
primary
way
to
obtain
illegal
firearms
.
 
it
's
just
not
really
a
bright
idea
to
use
this
method
when
yard
sales
are
safer
and
wo
n't
get
you
spotted
by
neighbors
.
yeah
,
i
know
you
can
figure
out
when
the
guy
leaves
his
house
,
but
why
spend
days
figuring
out
someone
's
patterns
of
behaviour
when
you
can
have
someone
buy
a
gun
at
a
store
for
you
,
or
pick
one
up
anonymously
at
a
yard
sale
?
<new_line>
no
because
they
did
n't
actually
exist
at
the
time
.
but
the
reason
for
the
second
amendment
is
so
that
we
will
be
able
to
protect
ourselves
from
the
government
if
we
need
to
.
if
guns
such
as
m-16
's
and
ak-47
's
are
restricted
to
government
use
,
then
who
's
more
powerful
?
the
people
or
the
government
?
the
fact
that
someone
has
a
gun
is
not
the
point
of
the
second
amendment
.
it
's
the
right
to
have
a
weapon
to
defend
ourselves
from
the
government
that
will
tell
us
we
do
n't
need
them
.
if
you
gave
the
average
person
a
grenade
or
an
ak-47
,
what
do
you
think
they
will
do
with
it
?
there
's
a
misconception
that
they
will
go
mad
and
shoot
everything
in
sight
,
when
really
they
will
probably
lock
it
away
.
now
tell
me
,
what
would
be
more
useful
during
a
home
invasion
:
the
ak-47
or
a
hunting
rifle
?
<new_line>
i
do
not
fully
understand
the
purpose
of
such
legislation
.
are
they
trying
to
cut
down
on
illegal
firearms
,
accidental
deaths
,
or
both
?
i
presume
this
pertains
to
the
u.s.a
.
illegal
firearms
obviously
,
legislation
can
not
reduce
the
number
of
these
.
accidental
deaths
i
believe
that
liberty
or
death
was
one
of
the
founding
principles
of
the
u.s.a
.
it
seems
stupid
to
replace
one
tyranny
with
another
.
governments
are
addicted
to
removing
people
's
rights
,
and
every
effort
should
be
made
to
prevent
them
from
doing
so
.
both
an
attempt
to
remove
both
will
be
covered
by
the
above
two
arguments
.
<new_line>
the
founding
fathers
did
n't
envision
phones
,
or
television
,
or
the
internet
,
should
our
first
amendment
rights
be
limited
to
things
they
had
like
print
,
and
speech
?
<new_line>
you
make
a
good
point
on
the
home
invasion
thing
but
how
often
does
that
actually
happen
?
i
do
n't
have
any
stats
but
i
'm
pretty
sure
there
are
a
lot
more
accidental
deaths
from
timmy
grabbing
dad
's
ak
and
playing
cowboys
and
indians
with
the
neighbor
kids
than
dad
using
it
to
stop
a
home
invasion
,
and
if
a
home
invasion
is
reason
for
buying
it
why
would
n't
a
handgun
do
the
trick
?
<new_line>
guns
that
kill
people
on
the
street
are
most
likely
obtained
illegally
.
tightening
gun
control
for
legal
firearms
that
are
bought
and
sold
legally
would
do
nothing
to
stop
the
crime
.
<new_line>
this
would
only
take
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
law
-
abiding
citizens
.
<new_line>
these
weapons
require
a
specific
,
and
very
expensive
,
permit
to
own
.
so
if
a
man
is
shot
with
an
m16
or
ak47
,
it
would
be
very
easy
for
authorities
to
find
everyone
in
the
city
who
owns
them
and
see
who
did
it
.
adding
to
that
,
people
who
would
go
on
a
killing
rampage
would
not
be
able
to
obtain
a
license
to
carry
these
weapons
.
<new_line>
what
are
you
saying
?
that
people
desire
to
kill
a
burglar
,
or
that
people
desire
to
protect
their
family
?
 
so
that
means
that
people
ought
n't
have
the
right
to
protect
themselves
when
a
break
-
in
does
occur
?
 
but
it
can
happen
.
a
large
portion
of
the
people
i
know
have
been
robbed
.
 
what
is
wrong
with
this
argument
?
 
and
if
those
300,000,000
guns
were
taken
away
,
what
would
come
of
the
millions
of
illegally
owned
firearms
?
 
that
's
quite
the
exaggeration
 
many
places
.
<new_line>
what
does
fund
matter
when
safety
is
involved
?
 
how
did
you
do
it
,
pray
tell
!
 
i
do
n't
know
;
i
never
did
.
however
,
i
'd
be
interested
in
knowing
how
to
do
so
.
 
both
of
which
are
extremely
dangerous
,
however
.
if
you
are
arguing
that
the
danger
/
power
is
fun
,
i
could
say
the
same
thing
for
rape
or
murder
,
depending
on
the
person
.
 
they
are
aesthetically
pleasant
.
 
how
many
people
actually
know
how
to
make
them
?
 
some
of
us
?
are
you
saying
that
you
are
like
this
?
if
so
,
this
is
a
side
of
you
i
've
never
seen
:
the
human
side
.
 
mainly
since
the
'
90s
.
i
'd
say
somewhere
around
the
mid-90s
:
amber
hagerman
,
jonbenet
ramsey
-
the
media
paid
too
much
attention
to
these
child
-
murders
and
people
came
to
accept
them
as
normal
.
<new_line>
yes
,
and
they
are
trying
to
do
so
in
quite
an
absurd
manner
.
 
usually
it
does
.
that
's
the
problem
with
not
being
an
american
.
 
that
was
the
old
way
!
modern
americans
hardly
even
know
about
the
revolutionary
war
.
 
it
does
,
does
n't
it
?
you
'd
think
that
people
would
realize
this
.
 
mainly
progressives
.
they
're
the
exact
opposite
of
libertarians
.
 
which
is
the
reason
that
the
"
right
to
bear
arms
"
was
included
in
the
first
point
.
*
however
,
you
did
n't
really
cover
accidental
deaths
in
your
"
accidental
deaths
"
section
.
would
n't
more
lives
be
saved
by
taking
away
all
of
america
's
legally
owned
guns
?
<new_line>
see
liberty
or
death
.
the
liberty
of
all
overshadows
the
deaths
of
few
.
<new_line>
but
if
we
have
gun
control
then
how
are
we
suppose
to
overthrow
our
government
when
they
fuck
up
?
<new_line>
exactly
,
which
is
why
anyone
with
half
a
brain
obtains
these
guns
from
shadowy
sources
,
if
they
intend
to
commit
a
crime
.
<new_line>
it
failed
due
to
the
fuel
not
being
volatile
enough
.
my
parents
would
n't
let
me
manufacture
anything
more
volatile
.
we
had
many
arguments
over
these
kinds
of
things
,
because
i
was
always
either
planning
to
create
dangerous
chemicals
,
or
was
on
the
verge
of
killing
myself
by
creating
dangerous
things
in
the
name
of
curiosity
and
experimentation
.
in
hindsight
i
was
fortunate
to
have
them
watching
over
me
.
 
it
's
all
pretty
easy
to
figure
out
on
your
own
,
though
.
 
maybe
,
but
they
hurt
a
non
-
consenting
party
.
 
again
,
not
very
hard
to
figure
out
.
 
do
n't
kid
yourself
.
 
yeah
.
it
really
made
child
abduction
and
murder
so
much
more
difficult
to
accomplish
.
<new_line>
wake
up
...
no
law
is
ever
going
to
make
the
world
safe
and
remove
all
accidents
and
crimes
.
the
world
has
sharp
edges
and
sometimes
people
get
hurt
,
not
to
make
light
of
this
it
is
awful
when
bad
things
happen
.
however
the
answer
is
n't
to
have
a
bunch
of
criminals
in
washington
take
away
more
of
our
rights
,
because
the
only
people
that
lose
are
those
of
us
that
follow
the
law
and
behave
responsible
.
it
is
time
for
us
to
start
remembering
that
liberty
and
freedom
has
a
price
tag
...
that
is
we
may
from
time
to
time
not
like
the
actions
of
our
neighbors
.
we
may
not
like
their
morals
,
manners
,
or
actions
however
if
they
are
not
harming
you
then
its
not
your
business
.
you
can
not
legislate
human
behavior
or
actions
if
i
want
a
gun
in
my
home
it
is
my
business
,
if
my
neighbor
wants
to
use
drugs
that
is
his
business
,
or
marry
someone
of
the
same
sex
,
etc
...
stop
trying
to
legislate
a
perfect
world
the
only
thing
you
gain
is
loss
of
liberty
.
not
for
nothing
but
the
only
time
i
was
forced
to
use
a
gun
for
violence
was
when
the
same
gang
of
criminals
in
washington
,
that
are
often
lobby
to
remove
gun
rights
,
sent
me
to
some
lousy
desert
to
do
there
bidding
.
i
do
n't
support
violence
in
any
way
shape
or
form
..
but
if
someone
wants
a
gun
its
there
business
and
it
does
n't
mean
there
violent
people
.
stop
allowing
these
bums
in
d.c
.
to
remove
our
rights
,
that
is
both
parties
,
government
has
the
monopoly
on
force
and
violence
do
n't
trust
it
.
make
no
mistake
i
am
not
an
anarchist
...
i
believe
in
liberty
!
yes
some
government
is
needed
but
to
enforce
natural
law
that
is
it
!
!
and
not
to
pick
on
democrats
but
if
you
think
your
party
is
any
better
when
it
comes
to
peace
then
the
lousy
republicans
...
what
parties
held
the
white
house
during
vietnam
and
the
korean
war
.
wars
of
nation
building
that
resulted
in
the
deaths
of
hundreds
of
thousands
.
wake
up
and
embrace
liberty
it
works
when
its
real
!
!
!
<new_line>
parents
!
always
holding
their
prodigies
back
!
 
my
curiosity
was
found
in
books
.
in
hindsight
,
i`d
say
i
was
much
better
off
.
 
as
can
those
types
of
weapons
.
a
flamethrower
-
however
powerful
it
was
-
if
used
in
the
right
location
,
could
cause
anything
from
mild
damage
to
a
forest
fire
.
 
no
.
it
is
still
extremely
rare
.
it
has
always
been
rare
.
children
,
in
britain
at
least
,
are
-
i
think
the
number
was
fifty
times
-
more
likely
to
die
inside
the
house
than
outside
.
child
abduction
is
still
nearly
unheard
of
.
most
cases
of
missing
children
,
the
child
is
a
runaway
.
family
abduction
accounts
for
most
of
the
abduction
cases
.
a
couple
thousand
are
abducted
by
strangers
each
year
.
how
many
children
are
in
the
country
?
60,000,000
+
.
they
do
n't
have
much
to
fear
.
also
,
they`d
be
safer
if
more
of
them
played
outside
.
who
is
going
to
abduct
a
child
in
the
midst
of
twenty
or
thirty+
friends
?
<new_line>
you
have
no
idea
.
i
wanted
to
make
a
plasma
cannon
but
no
one
would
help
me
with
the
necessary
components
.
plus
i
kept
designing
bombs
.
i
was
a
troubled
child
,
obviously
.
 
oh
,
i
read
too
,
entirely
non
-
fiction
.
it
took
a
lot
of
persuasion
for
me
to
finally
start
reading
fiction
.
it
did
n't
help
that
my
interests
gave
me
acid
burns
and
powder
burns
.
try
explaining
that
to
the
er
:
your
child
has
burnt
hands
from
black
powder
flashback
.
yeah
,
you
were
better
off
not
looking
into
these
things
.
 
most
technologies
we
take
for
granted
are
as
destructive
,
but
we
allow
them
.
we
should
be
able
to
enjoy
these
weapons
.
 
i
was
being
sarcastic
,
like
"
drat
!
now
we
ca
n't
abduct
children
anymore
to
test
our
latest
smallpox
vaccine
.
"
<new_line>
well
how
often
does
that
happen
?
the
death
toll
is
below
fifty
a
year
.
not
only
am
i
talking
about
home
invasion
,
but
the
general
store
robberies
,
madmen
in
public
areas
,
etc
.
the
death
toll
for
them
is
above
300
!
 
some
people
are
n't
comfortable
enough
with
a
gun
like
that
.
if
they
had
something
like
an
ak-47
what
right
does
the
government
have
to
take
his
right
away
?
i
have
a
strong
doubt
he
/
she
is
going
to
go
on
a
killing
spree
with
it
.
the
government
is
there
to
support
and
protect
rights
,
not
take
them
away
.
we
can
not
rely
on
the
government
for
all
our
protection
,
which
is
why
the
right
to
bear
arms
was
put
in
place
.
i
understand
a
natural
instinct
that
says
more
gun
control
reduces
crime
,
but
people
need
to
look
at
the
actual
stats
!
<new_line>
that
's
exactly
the
point
!
the
fact
that
it
is
so
hard
to
obtain
a
gun
has
created
the
statistic
of
80
percent
of
all
gun
crimes
committed
with
illegal
firearms
.
not
only
that
,
the
good
people
who
abide
by
the
law
can
not
protect
themselves
?

dumb

my

against

there
is
a

:
the

for

is

they
can
do

also

<new_line>
i
just
lacked
interest
.
i
thank
my
teachers
however
for
pressuring
me
into
fiction
because
it
opened
my
mind
to
many
great
authors
.
 
cars
have
utilities
and
disadvantages
.
flamethrowers
too
,
though
the
list
of
utilities
is
shorter
.
they
are
n't
only
for
killing
.
<new_line>
i
support
this
point
.
criminals
could
really
give
a
fuck
less
what
the
laws
are
.
they
'll
get
laundered
guns
anyways
.
<new_line>
hey
quick
question
for
you
...
why
were
these
weapons
made
?
they
were
made
for
the
government
,
the
same
government
that
wants
to
take
them
away
.
p.s
.
i
have
many
guns
and
as
i
stated
before
the
only
time
have
pulled
the
trigger
on
any
gun
for
violence
was
for
the
government
.
you
folks
that
think
your
political
party
can
be
trusted
are
sadly
mistaken
.
<new_line>
many
reasons
.
the
answers
range
from
war
to
genocide
to
hunting
to
law
enforcement
to
self
protection
.
 
that
's
not
their
only
purpose
and
it
's
not
that
simple
.
 
i
often
wonder
how
one
can
live
with
themselves
after
turning
a
gun
upon
someone
else
.
 
you
're
mistaken
if
you
think
this
comment
applies
to
me
.
<new_line>
unfortunately
our
government
has
set
it
up
so
that
we
can
not
overthrow
them
,
even
though
it
is
well
within
our
rights
(
if
not
our
requirement
)
as
described
in
the
declaration
of
independence
.
"
...
governments
are
instituted
among
men
,
deriving
their
just
powers
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
,
that
whenever
any
form
of
government
becomes
destructive
of
these
ends
,
it
is
the
right
of
the
people
to
alter
or
to
abolish
it
,
and
to
institute
new
government
,
laying
its
foundation
on
such
principles
and
organizing
its
powers
in
such
form
,
as
to
them
shall
seem
most
likely
to
effect
their
safety
and
happiness
"
.
our
forefathers
were
truly
amazing
men
.
<new_line>
actually
it
applies
worldwide
,
but
most
western
countries
have
populations
that
are
fearful
and
spineless
(
i
'm
looking
at
you
britain
,
australia
and
canada
)
,
so
america
is
one
of
the
few
modern
nations
where
owning
and
operating
guns
is
n't
so
heavily
regulated
,
and
the
population
has
strong
,
vocal
support
for
it
.
<new_line>
strict
gun
control
is
needed
.
it
is
now
2015
and
gun
violence
continues
to
grow
.
<new_line>
the
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention
has
a
startling
revelation
for
2015
.
it
is
projected
that
deaths
from
guns
will
surpass
deaths
from
car
fatalities
in
2015
.
an
estimated
33,000
americans
will
lose
their
lives
from
guns
as
opposed
to
an
estimated
32,000

ban
or
not
,
criminals
can
still
get
guns
.
the
only
true
way
to
fight
this
crime
is
to
prevent
yourself
from
being
a
victim
and
investing
in
a
firearm
to
protect
yourself
/
family
.
guns
have
become
a
way
of
lifestyle
and
major
hobby
and
a
ban
would
impact
their
lives
greatly
.
countries
that
have
introduced
strict
gun
bans
and
gun
control
showed
increases
(
major
increase
)
in
crime
and
homicides
.
to
summarize
it
all
:
guns
or
not
,
people
will
still
kill
people
.
so
,
in
layman
's
terms
,
nut
up
or
shut
up
.
<new_line>
if
firearms
were
banned
,
then
that
would
be
a
direct
violation
of
the
2nd
amendment
.
it
would
also
create
a
larger
black
market
for
guns
,
therefore
the
taxpayers
would
end
up
paying
for
more
regulation
and
more
trials
.
<new_line>
keep
guns
.
it
is
a
right
not
a
privilege
.
guns
do
n't
kill
people
,
people
do
.
<new_line>
what
about
the
case
in
that
school
with
adam
lanza
.
he
is
murder
from
birth
and
there
was
n't
anyone
to
stop
him
.
that
why
it
's
use
to
be
ban
on
the
keeping
and
buying
firearm
.
<new_line>
the
gun
violence
in
america
is
horrible
,
so
,
all
guns
should
be
banned
.

<new_line>
i
do
nt
think
that
is
a
bad
idea
.
with
the
increase
in
crimes
and
security
risks
,
individuals
needs
to
protect
themselves
from
harm
.
however
i
do
think
that
the
criminal
history
of
the
recepients
should
be
examined
to
make
sure
they
have
a
clean
criminal
background
,
that
they
are
in
good
mental
health
and
that
they
should
be
monitored
on
a
regular
basis
.
<new_line>
we
already
trust
law
abiding
citizens
to
own
guns
that
will
fire
a
bullet
with
every
trigger
pull
.
why
would
it
make
that
much
of
a
difference
if
the
gun
fired
continuous
bullets
?
it
only
takes
one
bullet
to
kill
,
and
currently
,
almost
no
one
is
using
them
in
that
fashion
.
the
ones
who
do
are
getting
them
illegally
,
so
selling
automatic
weapons
legally
would
n't
matter
to
them
because
they
would
get
it
from
the
black
market
anyways
,
not
a
sporting
goods
store
or
gun
shop
.
<new_line>
i
agree
its
not
a
bad
idea
;
because
its
a
freaking
terrible
one
.
all
the
evidence
says
that
if
you
are
in
possession
of
a
firearm
you
are
more
likely
to
get
shot
.
more
likely
.
anyone
who
wants
to
justify
owning
an
automatic
weapon
should
pop
over
to
australia
and
see
how
well
we
get
on
without
them
.
no
-
one
has
popped
a
cap
anywhere
around
me
or
mine
ever
.
that
s
right
ever
,
no
shootings
to
speak
of
and
no
armed
robberies
of
my
friends
or
family
,
ever
.
though
once
the
cat
,
or
gat
in
this
case
,
is
out
of
the
bag
i
am
not
sure
you
can
put
it
away
.
hard
to
see
how
the
states
could
get
all
those
guns
back
,
so
good
luck
champs
.
<new_line>
nope
.
there
have
been
hundreds
of
thousands
of
cases
in
which
people
have
defended
themselves
or
others
with
guns
.
look
up
this
link
below
.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc1071444/
 
and
comparing
australia
with
the
united
states
is
like
comparing
apples
and
oranges
.
the
australian
government
is
a
lot
different
than
the
one
in
the
united
states
.
you
ca
n't
conclusively
say
that
guns
are
the
main
factor
.
<new_line>
so
you
want
to
legalize
all
drugs
too
,
right
?
i
mean
,
after
all
,
if
someone
ca
n't
buy
heroine
from
a
supermarket
,
they
're
just
going
to
go
to
the
black
market
anyways
.
<new_line>
nope
.
there
's
a
difference
.
using
drugs
will
screw
up
a
person
's
mind
and
potentially
make
them
do
bad
things
.
a
gun
will
not
.
it
's
simply
a
tool
,
not
anything
that
will
alter
a
person
.
<new_line>
using
a
gun
could
screw
up
someone
's
mind
.
absolute
power
corrupts
absolutely
,
remember
?
but
you
are
right
,
a
gun
is
just
a
tool
.
it
is
not
dangerous
,
as
long
as
the
people
holding
it
do
n't
have
evil
intentions
.
and
so
making
automatic
weapons
legal
will
decrease
the
amount
people
who
have
evil
intentions
and
wish
to
have
automatic
weapons
how
?
<new_line>
cars
have
the
power
to
kill
people
.
in
fact
,
a
lot
more
cars
kill
people
than
guns
do
.
should
we
ban
cars
too
?
what
about
kitchen
knives
?
or
tire
irons
?
under
you
're
premise
,
having
a
deadly
tool
can
alter
someone
's
mind
,
so
we
should
get
rid
of
them
since
they
can
kill
people
.
and
for
your
second
point
,
most
people
who
want
guns
for
evil
intentions
do
n't
buy
them
from
a
gun
shop
.
they
buy
them
"
under
the
table
"
so
to
speak
.
the
legality
of
weapons
does
n't
matter
to
a
criminal
.
if
they
really
want
an
automatic
weapon
,
they
'll
find
a
way
to
get
one
.
it
makes
no
sense
to
bar
them
from
our
law
abiding
citizens
.
<new_line>
i
just
ca
n't
follow
the
leap
in
logic
that
if
criminals
have
/
will
acquire
automatic
weapons
,
law
abiding
citizens
need
to
have
automatic
weapons
as
well
.
there
's
just
not
really
a
logical
purpose
for
an
automatic
weapon
in
a
domestic
environment
.
<new_line>
if
criminals
have
more
firepower
than
the
law
abiding
citizen
,
it
becomes
a
problem
because
it
puts
the
potential
victim
at
a
disadvantage
.
there
are
many
instances
in
which
an
automatic
weapon
would
be
more
effective
against
multiple
targets
than
a
semi
auto
.
gang
break
-
ins
for
instance
.
occasionally
in
gang
related
intrusions
,
several
intruders
may
break
in
at
a
time
.
if
they
are
grouped
together
,
which
they
usually
are
,
a
full
auto
will
take
care
of
them
quite
nicely
.
<new_line>
what
you
are
doing
is
making
an
(
unreasonable
,
violent
)
solution
to
a
problem
that
may
be
prevented
from
happening
in
the
first
place
through
other
,
better
,
nonviolent
manners
.
you
could
have
an
alarm
system
for
your
house
,
you
could
have
neighborhood
watch
-
people
,
you
could
have
a
guard
dog
,
you
could
help
fund
local
school
systems
that
will
keep
teens
out
of
crime
while
simultaneously
giving
them
an
education
.
instead
of
promoting
a
radical
,
deadly
solution
to
these
kinds
of
problems
,
try
to
use
some
common
sense
.
you
do
n't
need
to
fight
fire
with
fire
.
sometimes
water
will
do
just
fine
.
<new_line>
alarms
systems
do
n't
always
run
a
criminal
out
of
your
house
,
and
it
often
takes
several
minutes
for
police
to
respond
.
neighborhood
watches
and
school
systems
are
ineffective
in
a
similar
fashion
.
they
reduce
the
likelihood
of
a
break
in
,
but
they
do
n't
help
much
once
it
's
already
happening
.
when
it
does
happen
and
someone
gets
into
your
home
with
hostile
intentions
,
the
safest
thing
to
do
is
to
kill
them
.
preferably
with
a
weapon
effective
for
the
task
.

you
linked
a
survey
.
we
all
know
gun
advocates
think
they
're
dirty
harry
,
find
some
police
stats
...
you
wo
n't
be
able
to
.
2
.
the
survey
you
linked
is
not
about
automatic
firearms
.
even
if
you
are
dirty
harry
,
it
only
takes
one
bullet
to
stop
an
intruder
,
not
100
.
as
for
comparisons
,
you
can
compare
australia
becaue
they
have
a
similar
socio
-
political
make
-
up
,
which
is
the
primary
contributor
to
crime
.
other
countries
with
a
similar
socio
-
political
make
-
up
include
the
scandinavian
countries
,
canada
,
england
,
and
france
-
all
of
which
show
similar
results
with
greater
gun
control
laws
.
now
,
you
can
argue
the
legitimacy
of
a
handgun
,
hunting
rifle
,
etc
,
and
i
would
say
it
should
be
a
local
issue
in
each
case
(
ie
south
central
chicago
might
want
different
laws
than
rural
alabama
)
.
what
you
can
not
do
is
say
that
having
a
oozi
is
self
-
protection
.
it
is
in
the
best
case
overkill
,
in
the
worst
case
a
criminal
who
just
has
not
been
caught
yet
.
<new_line>
ok
,
for
the
sake
of
discussion
,
lets
throw
out
the
survey
.
why
is
it
so
hard
to
believe
being
armed
and
knowing
how
to
use
your
weapons
effectively
will
make
you
safer
?
the
reason
you
ca
n't
compare
the
united
states
and
australia
on
the
subject
of
guns
is
because
it
wo
n't
produce
clean
results
.
in
order
to
accurately
compare
or
test
a
variable
,
the
variable
must
be
the
only
thing
that
changes
.
the
united
states
and
australia
have
different
laws
and
different
governments
,
so
it
's
impossible
to
derive
a
conclusive
result
about
one
variable
.
furthermore
,
the
socio
-
political
makeup
is
different
in
the
united
states
.
countries
like
australia
,
canada
,
england
,
and
france
all
have
a
lot
more
socialism
for
instance
.
part
of
my
argument
for
this
is
common
sense
.
if
a
criminal
is
lawless
enough
to
use
a
weapon
for
malicious
purposes
,
will
he
really
care
about
the
legality
of
his
weapons
?
there
's
always
a
black
market
to
turn
to
almost
anywhere
in
the
world
.
also
,
guns
are
n't
the
only
way
violence
can
be
carried
out
.
if
people
really
want
to
hurt
other
people
,
they
'll
find
a
way
to
do
it
.
i
agree
with
you
that
gun
laws
should
be
a
local
issue
.
in
some
cases
,
an
automatic
weapon
is
more
effective
than
a
semi
auto
for
self
defense
(
such
as
when
several
intruders
break
into
a
home
at
once
,
or
when
someone
breaks
in
with
armor
)
.
i
know
these
cases
are
very
rare
,
but
they
do
happen
occasionally
.
and
when
they
do
,
an
oozi
is
in
fact
a
sensible
choice
.
that
's
why
the
military
uses
automatic
m-16s
.
<new_line>
a
lot
of
things
are
common
sense
.
the
numbers
show
that
one
who
owns
a
gun
is
far
more
likely
to
accidently
shoot
himself
,
or
have
a
child
who
figures
out
a
way
to
shoot
themself
,
then
to
ever
encounter
an
intruder
.
home
intrusions
where
the
owner
is
home
are
less
common
than
accidental
shootings
,
that
's
a
fact
.
i
have
no
problem
with
guns
,
in
fact
i
like
them
.
i
live
though
2
blocks
from
the
lv
strip
,
and
i
would
"
feel
"
safer
knowing
it
was
hard
for
my
neighbors
to
get
their
hands
on
a
gun
,
than
i
would
with
one
of
my
own
.
very
few
gun
control
advocates
advocate
total
gun
control
,
that
is
a
strawman
the
nra
made
up
.
most
gun
control
advocates
simply
want
local
municipalities
to
be
allowed
to
look
at
the
numbers
and
say
"
okay
,
you
can
have
a
handgun
but
not
an
automatic
"
in
such
and
such
a
community
,
"
you
can
carry
whatever
you
want
in
this
community
"
or
if
you
're
in
the
middle
of
the
ghetto
,
maybe
you
can
only
own
a
hunting
rifle
.
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
this
.
<new_line>
the
numbers
show
that
one
who
owns
a
gun
is
far
more
likely
to
accidentally
shoot

,
or
have
a

home
intrusions
where
the
owner
is
home
are
less
common
than
accidental
shootings
,
that
's
a
fact
.
i
believe
you
will
find
,
however
,
that
the
vast
majority
of
accidental
shootings
are
non
-
lethal
.
intruders
who
break
into
an
occupied
home
on
the
other
hand
,
are
likely
to
know
the
house
is
occupied
,
and
come
prepared
with
a
weapon
and
have
a
conscious
will
to
do
damage
.
 
i
'm
actually
a
member
of
the
nra
,
and
i
have
yet
to
hear
from
them
that
the
feds
will
completely
ban
all
guns
.
what
they
will
do
however
,
is
take
smaller
steps
on
a
slippery
slope
.
things
like
bigger
taxes
on
ammunition
,
a
higher
charge
to
obtain
certain
permits
,
bans
on
certain
accessories
,
and
even
misleading
legislation
such
as
the
"
assault
rifle
"
ban
that
would
include
many
common
hunting
rifles
.
 
neither
do
i.
but
the
problem
is
that
it
is
a
slippery
slope
.
the
general
trend
in
the
past
has
been
to
legislate
with
continually
more
restrictive
laws
,
and
they
seldom
get
repealed
.
this
is
what
has
gun
enthusiasts
upset
.
trivial
laws
are
n't
so
trivial
when
they
continue
to
build
up
.
and
futhermore
,
who
gets
to
decide
what
is
reasonable
?
you
may
end
up
with
a
county
of
gun
control
extremeists
who
wo
n't
let
you
have
anything
,
or
you
may
have
one
that
lets
people
have
rpgs
.
<new_line>
first
of
all
,
denying
individuals
the
access
to
firearms
is
not
a
good
idea
because
they
will
still
find
illegal
ways
to
posess
weapons
and
this
will
be
worst
because
in
the
legal
format
of
owing
weapons
,
the
government
can
keep
a
registry
of
firearm
owners
and
monitor
them
but
in
the
illegal
way
,
the
government
has
no
idea
who
owns
firearms
and
this
can
cause
a
threat
to
society
.
secondly
,
you
ca
nt
deny
anyone
access
to
firearm
because
the
2nd
ammendment
itself
does
not
prohibit
giving
firearms
to
civilians
.
if
your
standpoint
of
argument
is
the
fact
that
firearms
increases
the
level
of
criminality
of
civilians
,
then
that
argument
in
itself
is
a
constitutional
violation
of
the
civilian
rights
based
on
the
constitution
on
which
this
country
was
built
.
thirdly
,
guns
are
needed
for
protection
in
areas
that
have
a
high
crime
rate
.
a
perfect
example
is
a
young
father
who
i
personally
knew
,
and
who
was
also
a
business
man
.
he
was
robbed
in
front
of
his
wife
and
children
and
then
shot
in
the
head
and
left
to
die
.
take
that
for
an
example
and
imagine
if
he
had
access
to
a
gun
for
his
and
his
family
protection
,
what
would
have
happened
.
<new_line>
your
entire
argument
is
irrelevant
.
your
first
point
merely
echoes
my
point
about
illegal
/
illicit
drugs
(
why
not
legalize
meth
,
crack
,
cocaine
,
and
everything
else
because
then
the
government
can
keep
a
registry
of
drug
owners
and
monitor
them
but
in
the
illegal
way
the
government
has
no
idea
who
owns
drugs
and
this
can
cause
a
threat
to
society
)
.
see
,
you
just
substituted
firearms
for
drugs
.
secondly
and
most
importantly
,
the
debate
is
about
automatic
firearms
.
tell
me
where
i
ever
wanted
to
take
away
your
"
god
-
given
"
second
amendment
(
by
the
way
,
just
to
point
out
,
who
cares
if
it
's
in
the
constitution
.
the
constitution
is
a
man
made
document
,
and
as
such
is
fallible
.
that
's
why
there
are
amendments
like
the
second
,
and
why
the
negro
is
no
longer
3/5
a
person
,
and
18
year
olds
,
women
,
and
minorities
can
vote
)
.
 
an
automatic
weapon
would
have
probably
been
more
dangerous
in
this
situation
,
especially
since
the
criminal
would
have
had
a
higher
probability
of
owning
an
automatic
weapon
as
well
.
<new_line>
this
is
not
so
.
meth
and
cocaine
can
not
be
used
in
a
positive
way
since
they
will
always
cause
bodily
harm
.
guns
on
the
other
hand
,
can
be
used
for
hunting
and
protection
.
 
the
point
being
made
was
that
banning
guns
wo
n't
help
the
potential
victims
.
criminals
seldom
obtain
their
guns
by
legal
means
.
<new_line>
first
of
all
,
meth
and
cocaine
can
not
be
used
in
a
case
of
self
defense
.
the
whole
purpose
of
legalizing
firearms
is
the
fact
that
it
can
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
self
defence
when
a
person
's
life
is
in
danger
.
no
one
has
the
right
to
own
these
types
of
substances
because
by
law
,
they
are
illegal
.
gun
is
an
equipment
and
not
a
substance
.
meth
and
cocaine
are
substances
.
what
are
the
benefits
of
owning
drugs
in
terms
of
saving
your
lives
?
can
you
use
it
to
defend
yourself
?
let
me
ask
you
this
question
,
if
you
do
nt
care
about
the
constitution
because
it
is
man
made
then
how
come
you
care
about
the
illegality
of
crack
or
meth
?
did
nt
man-
made
laws
made
those
substances
illegal
?
the
ammendments
were
made
to
the
constitution
because
as
we
approached
a
liberal
era
,
the
people
gained
more
rights
.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
ammendments
are
to
protect
the
people
from
the
power
of
the
government
when
used
in
an
unfair
manner
.
you
should
be
thankful
that
the
constitutional
gave
minorites
and
the
women
the
right
to
vote
.
the
constitution
never
prohibited
in
the
whole
,
that
right
was
added
on
to
it
to
widen
the
rights
of
the
people
.
if
the
father
had
access
to
a
weapon
,
then
his
life
would
have
been
saved
.
what
can
be
more
dangerous
than
a
father
losing
his
life
?
how
much
dangerous
can
it
get
?
<new_line>
it
's
a
terrible
idea
.
i
mean
seriously
why
would
a
regular
person
ever
need
a
automatic
firearm
.
i
'm
from
sweden
and
the
only
civilians
allowed
to
own
weapons
are
hunters
and
even
they
have
a
relatively
hard
time
getting
a
weapon
.
a
country
can
function
just
fine
without
regular
people
owning
weapons
.
<new_line>
first
of
all
to
blindly
follow
your
us
constitution
in
modern
days
is
ridicules
because
times
and
ways
of
life
change
.
and
to
answer
your
exiting
question
the
rest
of
the
family
might
have
been
shot
as
well
.
<new_line>
in
reference
to
the
constitution
,
it
is
interesting
how
you
fail
to
mention
the
13th
,
14th
and
15th
amendments
which
are
directly
amending
the
constitution
,
not
just
adding
things
.
also
,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
you
to
george
carlin
in
reference
to
rights
.
if
something
is
a
"
right
,
"
how
is
it
possible
that
rights
change
with
time
?
either
it
is
a
right
,
or
it
is
not
;
it
is
not
subject
to
the
whims
of
the
people
,
politicians
,
or
populations
.
i
believe
in
your
right
to
self
-
defense
.
i
do
n't
believe
in
your
"
right
"
to
an
automatic
weapon
(
especially
when
a
normal
,
non
-
automatic
gun
would
suffice
)
.
 
perhaps
the
family
gets
hit
in
the
crossfire
.
or
a
witness
.
or
anyone
else
besides
the
assailant
and
victim
.
<new_line>
do
you
shoot
moose
with
machine
guns
?
do
you
need
an
ak
for
protecting
yourself
from
muggers
?
 
where
have
i
said
anything
about
banning
guns
.
take
your
guns
,
fine
,
you
may
have
that
"
right
.
"
that
does
not
,
however
,
give
you
the
right
to
fire
any
kind
of
weaponry
you
want
.
if
you
want
to
take
this
back
to
the
founders
,
they
would
be
appalled
at
the
way
people
abuse
the
second
amendment
in
order
to
justify
owning
frivolous
(
for
civilians
)
arms
.
the
worst
they
had
were
muskets
(
inaccurate
at
that
)
and
canons
(
more
so
)
that
came
no
where
near
the
deadly
force
of
even
a
handgun
today
.
<new_line>
why
do
you
follow
the
laws
that
were
created
100s
of
years
ago
?
are
nt
they
man
made
?
and
to
respond
to
you
,
those
childre
n
are
orhans
now
because
their
father
was
killed
not
able
to
defend
himself
.
even
though
the
children
saw
their
father
killed
,
at
a
distance
they
saw
him
being
shot
they
could
not
have
been
injured
.
<new_line>
hunting
with
automatic
weapons
is
illegal
in
the
united
states
and
unsportsmanlike
besides
.
although
if
a
bear
is
charging
at
you
,
it
would
be
good
to
have
an
automatic
.45
to
kill
it
before
it
kills
you
.
and
automatic
weapons
are
much
more
effective
than
semi
-
autos
to
eliminate
multiple
or
armored
targets
(
such
as
gang
break
-
ins
,
or
an
intruder
with
a
bullet
proof
vest
)
.
 
they
most
certainly
would
not
.
every
one
of
them
thoroughly
understood
the
importance
of
having
an
armed
citizenry
,
and
they
encouraged
the
ownership
of
guns
as
much
as
they
could
.
without
the
strong
prevalence
of
firearms
in
early
america
,
they
could
have
never
succeeded
in
their
revolution
,
and
without
the
continuation
of
armed
citizens
,
the
government
could
obtain
absolute
power
and
oppress
the
people
.
 
but
the
important
part
was
the
fact
that
weapons
were
evenly
matched
.
people
could
still
kill
each
other
with
firearms
,
and
often
did
in
the
revolution
.
thousands
upon
thousands
of
people
met
their
fate
at
the
end
of
a
gun
making
the
gun
violence
of
today
a
drop
in
the
bucket
(
despite
the
fact
that
they
are
more
advanced
)
.
everyone
was
well
aware
of
their
lethal
potential
,
and
yet
they
were
encouraged
anyways
because
when
a
society
is
armed
,
citizens
are
much
more
reluctant
to
commit
a
crime
and
governments
are
much
more
reluctant
to
oppress
the
people
.
<new_line>
the
13th
,
14th
and
15th
ammendment
was
made
to
the
constitution
to
widen
the
rights
of
the
people
because
governments
could
infringe
upon
the
rights
of
the
people
.
it
is
because
of
the
constitution
that
we
are
protected
in
our
homes
or
else
the
government
could
barge
in
and
carry
out
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
and
then
use
that
evidence
to
deprive
us
of
life
,
liberty
and
property
.
many
people
misinterpets
the
meaning
of
'
rights
.
'
it
is
not
a
right
itself
that
changes
overtime
,
it
is
we
the
people
who
give
governments
the
power
to
take
a
right
away
from
us
because
according
to
howard
zinn
,
the
government
gets
it
power
from
the
people
and
power
and
rights
come
from
the
people
,
not
the
government
.
do
you
think
the
constitution
was
created
by
a
government
?
whether
you
believe
in
the
right
to
firearm
or
not
is
what
your
opinion
is
but
majority
of
the
population
would
agree
that
law
abiding
citizens
have
a
right
to
firearms
which
is
why
the
constitution
permitting
the
use
of
firearms
was
never
challenged
.
if
you
are
saying
that
we
should
not
give
firearms
to
people
because
other
people
might
get
killed
,
then
what
you
are
implying
is
that
we
should
take
away
the
means
from
a
person
to
protect
themselves
and
let
them
die
when
we
can
provide
them
with
the
equipment
that
can
save
their
lives
.
and
by
the
way
,
majority
of
the
crimes
committed
are
committed
by
illegal
gun
posession
and
not
legal
gun
posession
.
the
13th
,
14th
,
and
15th
ammendments
were
rights
bestowed
upon
the
people
in
the
constituion
and
not
changes
made
to
the
constitution
.
<new_line>
no
.
an
armed
society
is
a
polite
society
.
;)
<new_line>
not
sure
about
whether
or
not
it
's
a
good
or
bad
idea
but
,
i
'll
tell
ya
,
it
is
easily
a
fantastic
form
of
entertainment
.
<new_line>
i
do
follow
laws
but
laws
are
updated
often
enough
to
make
most
of
them
make
sense
.
the
us
constitution
is
old
and
could
use
updating
just
like
any
other
set
of
laws
.
it
's
true
that
it
would
complicated
to
revoke
peoples
right
to
bear
arms
but
if
it
would
be
done
it
would
be
for
the
better
.
and
i
apologize
if
i
upset
you
with
my
answer
to
your
question
regarding
the
family
but
what
i
meant
was
that
the
situation
could
have
been
escalated
to
a
far
more
dangerous
situation
should
the
father
have
pulled
a
gun
on
the
robber
.
the
father
would
like
any
other
normal
person
have
been
slightly
hesitant
about
shooting
someone
.
<new_line>
it
most
certainly
would
not
be
for
the
better
,
and
i
believe
you
underestimate
american
attachment
to
their
gun
rights
.
there
are
several
million
gun
owners
here
,
and
if
the
right
to
bear
arms
was
revoked
,
there
would
almost
certainly
be
a
civil
war
.
especially
considering
the
fact
that
most
of
the
armed
services
would
likely
side
with
gun
owners
.
  
most
gun
owners
(
in
the
us
anyways
)
are
quite
competent
with
their
firearms
,
and
i
can
tell
you
from
experience
,
the
hesitation
does
n't
happen
when
you
or
your
family
is
in
danger
.
<new_line>
first
of
all
,
most
of
the
laws
are
updated
because
of
the
constitution
.
in
most
of
the
instances
,
government
might
create
or
already
have
a
law
that
is
infringing
upon
the
rights
of
the
people
so
when
a
person
is
incacerated
because
of
the
vagueness
,
ex
post
facto
or
inefficient
law
,
the
supreme
court
has
to
interpret
the
constitution
and
then
apply
it
to
update
the
law
.
there
are
so
many
case
laws
that
were
created
from
the
constitution
and
so
many
laws
created
by
legislators
were
striked
down
because
it
was
seen
as
a
violation
of
civilian
rights
when
interpreted
by
the
constitution
.
do
you
think
,
that
if
we
are
in
a
emergency
,
we
can
always
depend
on
police
officers
to
save
us
?
do
you
think
that
if
i
call
911
,
and
there
is
a
man
holding
a
gun
,
and
the
cops
take
appromixately
15
mins
to
arrive
,
between
the
scope
of
that
15
minuites
,
i
will
be
begging
for
my
life
and
defenseless
infront
of
my
perpretator
only
for
the
cop
to
arrive
and
then
find
my
dead
body
.
as
it
is
,
many
laws
are
already
favorable
to
the
defendant
and
what
you
are
proposing
is
a
law
favorable
to
the
defendant
because
the
victim
is
not
allowed
to
carry
a
weapon
but
at
the
same
time
,
the
defendant
will
still
carry
a
weapon
even
if
it
is
illegal
for
the
sole
purpose
of
robbing
someone
or
killing
someone
.
i
agree
with
you
that
maybe
the
situation
could
have
escalated
but
how
do
you
know
that
it
could
have
?
are
you
certain
or
just
making
a
presumption
?
how
come
in
many
other
cases
,
people
that
uses
gun
for
self
defence
do
nt
end
up
injuring
other
members
of
their
families
in
the
process
of
defending
themselves
.
take
for
example
the
connecticut
murders
that
took
place
recently
,
in
which
the
father
was
tied
up
,
beaten
,
wife
and
two
daughters
killed
in
which
one
of
the
daughter
was
raped
infront
of
the
family
before
she
was
killed
.
do
nt
you
think
that
if
the
father
or
mature
family
member
had
access
to
a
weapon
,
all
this
could
have
been
prevented
?
or
are
you
going
to
say
that
somebody
else
could
have
been
hurt
?
cause
the
entire
family
with
the
exception
of
the
father
died
.
<new_line>
i
agree
with
you
.
banning
the
use
of
firearms
on
civilians
would
most
certainly
introduce
a
new
civil
war
in
society
and
more
damage
to
the
society
than
one
could
imagine
.
because
if
a
right
is
taken
awasy
from
them
,
then
they
will
see
it
as
a
form
of
dictatorship
and
hence
try
to
rebel
since
it
is
a
right
granted
to
them
by
the
constitution
.
not
only
would
it
create
a
civil
war
but
the
crime
rate
will
also
go
up
because
the
illegal
firearm
owners
will
now
have
the
upper
hand
on
choosing
and
attacking
their
potential
victims
.
<new_line>
by
revoking
peoples
right
to
bare
arms
i
did
n't
mean
that
the
government
is
to
swoop
down
and
forcefully
collect
everybody
's
guns
,
i
was
thinking
of
something
a
bit
more
gradual
like
perhaps
starting
with
putting
up
restrictions
to
make
it
more
difficult
to
buy
a
gun
.
and
on
the
second
point
i
sincerely
hope
that
all
americans
are
n't
so
hardened
and
cold
that
they
could
without
even
a
second
of
hesitation
pull
out
a
gun
and
immediately
shoot
someone
.
to
believe
that
any
regular
person
no
matter
the
country
could
easily
gun
down
an
other
person
is
delusional
.
i
'm
not
trying
to
be
offensive
and
i
understand
that
there
are
people
that
would
have
an
easier
time
shooting
someone
than
others
but
the
reality
is
that
most
people
would
hesitate
even
for
only
the
briefest
moment
and
that
moment
can
be
vital
to
what
happens
next
.
<new_line>
i
agree
with
you
on
many
of
your
points
and
in
present
day
america
changing
the
policy
on
guns
would
be
extremely
difficult
but
you
must
agree
with
me
when
i
say
that
a
country
functions
better
without
such
an
abundance
of
guns
.
and
i
also
agree
that
the
incident
in
connecticut
could
have
most
certainly
been
prevented
should
one
of
them
had
access
to
a
gun
.
i
still
stand
by
my
belief
that
a
country
should
in
any
case
function
better
and
be
safer
in
the
long
run
without
such
free
access
to
guns
.
<new_line>
i
do
not
agree
with
you
that
a
country
can
run
better
without
the
abundance
of
guns
.
i
believe
you
are
under
the
presumption
that
anyone
can
have
acess
to
a
gun
.
not
anyone
however
can
have
access
to
a
gun
so
in
other
words
,
access
to
guns
are
not
free
.
it
is
limited
because
there
are
other
factors
that
helps
to
determine
who
is
better
suited
for
a
gun
.
these
factors
includes
criminal
history
or
any
mental
evaluation
and
furthermore
,
the
government
keeps
a
registry
for
firearm
holders
and
monitor
their
use
by
also
requiring
them
to
renew
their
registration
yearly
.
<new_line>
that
is
a
shame
because
crime
wise
many
countries
are
functioning
better
.
<new_line>
you
ca
nt
compare
one
country
to
another
when
there
is
a
difference
in
the
sizes
of
the
population
as
well
as
other
social
factors
which
can
be
responsible
for
one
effect
.
<new_line>
i
fear
that
i
might
have
been
unclear
you
see
i
accidentally
strayed
from
the
subject
but
i
only
wonder
if
you
honestly
believe
that
in
the
future
america
will
have
truly
benefited
from
your
current
weapon
policy
.
and
you
are
correct
the
us
ca
n't
be
seen
as
one
country
when
it
comes
to
laws
but
gradually
change
the
approach
to
guns
in
individual
states
.
i
admit
its
a
bit
naive
of
me
to
think
that
your
entire
country
would
n't
be
pissed
about
one
of
there
rights
.
i
want
you
to
think
past
the
inevitable
impact
of
removing
a
right
and
think
of
the
benefits
afterwards
granted
that
you
are
n't
launched
into
a
civil
war
in
which
case
you
'd
be
screwed
.
<new_line>
by
whom
?
 
why
is
a
negro
no
longer
3/5
a
person
,
then
?
that
was
in
the
constitution
.
you
are
overlooking
the
basic
,
transient
,
flexible
nature
of
the
constitution
.
also
,
you
are
overlooking
the
entire
premise
of
the
debate
:
automatic
weapons
.
<new_line>
yes
,
shooting
an
automatic
weapon
in
a
domestic
area
sounds
like
a
fine
idea
.
it
's
similar
to
gassing
a
house
with
a
family
in
it
in
order
to
kill
some
ants
.
at
least
you
killed
all
the
ants
,
right
?
 
you
do
n't
think
that
's
a
strawman
argument
?
here
's
what
happens
with

education
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
almost
universally
acknowledged
as
the
best
way
for
people
to
influence
their
government
(
without
bloody
revolution
)
.
an
in
fact
,
those
with
a
low
education
are
more
likely
to
commit
crimes
(
http://www.fightcrime.org/sites/default/files/reports/mi%20cops%20and%20tots_0.pdf
)
so
would
it
not
make
more
sense
for
people
to
invest
more
energy
and
money
in
the
education
effort
rather
than
the
armament
effort
?
<new_line>
do
you
realize
that
break
-
ins
are
n't
always
a
one
man
job
?
and
do
you
also
know
that
some
intruders
wear
body
armor
?
automatic
weapons
are
more
effective
against
such
targets
.
 
no
,
because
it
has
happened
in
the
past
.
also
,
that
was
one
of
the
main
reasons
the
founders
encouraged
people
to
be
armed
.
 
allowing
citizens
to
own
automatic
weapons
does
n't
necessitate
a
draw
on
government
resources
.
<new_line>
if
you
read
the
original
constitution
,
you
would
see
that
it
did
not
stated
"
blacks
are
3/5
of
a
person
.
"
what
it
sates
is
"
3/5
of
all
other
persons
"
because
that
portion
of
the
constitution
was
referring
to
the
population
of
the
blacks
.
and
also
automatic
weapons
has
no
bearing
on
an
argument
prohibiting
the
use
of
civilians
for
self
defence
.
<new_line>
it
said
that
only
3/5
of
the
black
population
counted
in
representation
for
states
,
thus
effectively
making
a
black
person
worth
3/5
.
regardless
,
this
section
was
directly
changed
by
the
14th
amendment
.
i
do
n't
understand
why
you
are
arguing
whether
or
not
the
constitution
has
been
changed
.
i
'm
saying
automatic
weapons
are
entirely
superfluous
if
one
wishes
to
protect
him
or
herself
.
a
small
arm
,
or
non
-
automatic
weapon
would
suffice
just
fine
.
<new_line>
there
's
really
no
way
i
can
argue
with
you
.
yes
,
shooting
a
spray
of
bullets
at
"
enemies
"
will
be
more
efficient
than
taking
the
time
to
individually
shoot
each
person
,
but
that
does
not
necessitate
owning
automatic
weapons
.
 
jesus
christ
,
please
stay
on
topic
,
this
is
getting
exhausting
.
i
earlier
said
,
keep
your
arms
.
i
'm
not
asking
to
deprive
you
of
all
guns
,
merely
automatic
.
this
is
a
rather
good
site
:
http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcassaul.html
 
it
says
that
.2
%
(
1/5
of
1
%
)
of
violent
crimes
are
perpetrated
with
assault
weapons
(
even
using
their
broad
definition
)
.
therefore
,
to
claim
that
you
need
an
automatic
weapon
to
defend
you
and
your
family
against
these
hordes
of
automatic
-
weapon
-
bearing
criminals
is
simply
ludicrous
.
 
no
,
but
the
billions
(
to
trillions
worldwide
)
of
money
spent
on
arming
ourself
with
firearms
could
largely
be
used
more
efficiently
spent
on
better
educating
a
nation
.
<new_line>
throwing
civilians
at
a
criminal
?
grabbing
civilians
by
the
legs
and
swinging
them
like
a
baseball
bat
?
i
might
question
the
effectiveness
of
such
.
<new_line>
when
someone
(
or
multiple
people
)
break
into
your
house
,
seconds
count
.
especially
when
the
intruders
are
armed
.
 
how
about
shotguns
?
or
pistols
?
they
kill
people
just
as
well
as
an
"
assault
rifle
"
and
most
are
a
lot
cheaper
.
and
no
,
you
probably
wo
nt
ever
encounter
a
situation
in
which
you
need
an
automatic
.
just
like
you
will
probably
never
need
to
use
a
concealed
weapon
for
your
own
defense
.
but
the
point
is
that
it
's
better
to
be
allowed
to
have
it
on
the
chance
that
the
need
arises
.
 
sure
it
could
.
but
making
laws
that
decide
where
private
sector
money
goes
is
called
socialism
.
and
socialism
wo
n't
work
in
this
country
.
<new_line>
then
the
conflict
would
only
be
delayed
.
there
would
be
continually
more
public
unrest
and
protesting
until
it
eventually
became
violent
just
as
it
would
be
if
they
were
confiscated
.
 
i
speak
from
experience
on
this
particular
topic
,
and
it
's
not
something
that
anyone
wants
to
be
faced
with
.
but
there
are
times
when
a
person
must
protect
himself
and
his
family
because
he
has
a
duty
to
them
and
to
himself
.
even
if
that
means
killing
the
attacker
.
<new_line>
i
deeply
apologize
for
the
error
in
my
argument
.
i
meant
the
use
of
firearms
for
self
defence
.
i
was
at
the
time
,
multi
tasking
so
i
am
sorry
about
the
error
in
my
statement
.
<new_line>
you
said
it
yourself
.
3/5
of
the
black
population
.
thus
,
there
is
a
difference
between
a
black
person
or
any
type
of
person
being
the
value
of
3/5
of
a
person
and
3/5
of
a
population
.
but
anyway
back
to
the
argument
.
i
brought
up
the
fact
that
the
right
to
a
firearm
is
within
the
constitution
.
you
argued
that
the
constitution
is
infallible
or
was
changed
.
so
you
are
the
one
that
raised
the
effectiveness
of
the
constitution
,
not
me
.
if
a
person
chooses
to
have
an
automatic
firearm
or
not
,
that
is
his
decision
,
as
long
as
he
stays
within
the
confine
of
the
law
because
as
a
civilian
,
he
has
certain
rights
that
the
state
can
not
rid
him
of
and
the
claim
that
owning
a
firearm
is
a
potential
for
further
criminality
in
a
given
population
is
a
broad
generalization
in
an
argument
without
proper
proof
to
prove
so
.
furthermore
,
if
you
are
claiming
that
possession
of
gun
leads
to
further
criminality
then
i
am
surprised
that
your
perception
of
small
non
automatic
guns
is
different
because
gun
in
the
whole
can
be
a
danger
depending
on
how
and
where
you
use
it
.
your
solution
to
a
problem
will
have
no
effect
on
the
problem
at
present
if
that
is
what
you
are
proposing
for
a
change
.
<new_line>
i
do
n't
think
you
understand
math
.
 
which
one
?
it
ca
n't
be
both
.
i
'm
fairly
certain
i
argued
the
constitution
has
been
changed
,
and
your
refusal
to
accept
a
basic
understanding
of
history
does
not
change
history
.
 
speaking
of
broad
generalizations
...
<new_line>
there
is
literally
no
point
in
arguing
this
.
it
is
not
so
much
you
have
convinced
me
of
anything
,
or
i
feel
like
you
make
valid
points
,
so
much
as
it
is
that
you
are
so
entrenched
in
your
ideas
of
why
one
should
be
able
to
carry
deadly
weapons
and
inflict
deadly
harm
on
someone
at
any
time
that
i
can
not
even
hope
to
"
win
"
the
debate
.
also
,
this
debate
is
entirely
unrelated
to
socialism
.
<new_line>
i
do
nt
think
you
understand
english
enough
to
understand
the
difference
between
the
words
"
person
"
as
you
claimed
earlier
and
the
term
"
population
.
"
your
argument
is
based
on
a
phrase
of
the
constitution
which
you
yourself
is
not
sure
what
the
correct
meaning
of
that
phrase
is
.
if
you
were
smart
enough
you
would
figure
that
when
i
was
referring
to
"
certain
rights
"
i
was
referring
to
the
2nd
ammendment
.
you
should
probably
check
up
the
meaning
of
"
broad
generalizations
"
as
well
because
it
seems
you
have
an
issue
in
understanding
the
basics
of
english
.
<new_line>
its
ok
to
stray
off
topic
sometimes
to
establish
your
point
.
how
can
we
know
if
this
country
will
benefit
from
that
policy
until
you
give
them
a
chance
to
put
it
into
effect
.
and
like
i
would
have
mentioned
earlier
in
my
argument
,
the
use
of
firearms
in
the
home
for
self
defence
has
helped
to
save
many
lives
in
the
past
and
majority
of
the
crimes
committed
are
committed
by
illegal
firearm
holders
.
this
should
be
a
clear
indicator
that
legal
ownership
of
guns
in
no
way
has
increased
potential
criminality
for
law
abiding
citizens
.
i
strongly
think
that
if
you
remove
that
rights
and
lets
assume
that
a
civil
war
occurs
.
now
lets
think
past
that
,
do
nt
you
think
the
civil
war
will
cause
the
economy
as
well
as
the
social
structure
of
this
country
to
collapse
and
plunge
us
into
a
new
era
of
severe
depression
?
<new_line>
law
abiding
citizens
is
based
on
how
they
've
acted
so
far
!
just
because
they
have
been
law
abiding
for
the
time
they
have
does
n't
mean
they
always
will
be
.
also
,
hunting
accidents
are
common
enough
,
if
automatic
weapons
were
in
use
,
and
a
misfire
or
the
like
happened
the
effect
could
be
much
more
extreme
.
law
abiding
does
not
mean
entirely
responsible
.
<new_line>
under
that
logic
,
we
should
n't
allow
anyone
to
have
guns
since
they
may
one
day
snap
and
go
on
a
shooting
rampage
.
in
fact
,
we
really
should
n't
even
allow
people
to
have
cars
since
they
may
snap
and
mow
down
pedestrians
,
or
ram
a
school
bus
.
come
to
think
of
it
,
we
might
as
well
just
lock
everyone
up
in
padded
cells
so
that
no
one
can
get
hurt
ever
.
 
actually
hunting
accidents
are
very
rare
,
and
when
they
do
happen
,
it
is
usually
due
to
the
elements
,
not
a
misfire
.
furthermore
,
hunting
with
automatic
weapons
is
illegal
,
unnecessary
,
and
not
the
topic
of
this
particular
debate
.
there
are
many
gun
restrictions
specific
to
hunting
that
do
n't
apply
for
other
types
of
shooting
.
 
it
is
impossible
to
ever
be
able
to
guage
how
responsible
someone
is
100
%
,
and
it
will
always
be
fraught
with
bias
.
that
does
n't
mean
we
should
eliminate
a
right
because
there
have
been
a
few
wing
nuts
out
there
.
<new_line>
the
constitution
was
not
taking
a
census
,
you
do
realize
.
they
were
saying
that
3/5
of
"
all
other
persons
"
(
i.e.
slaves
and
other
racial
minorities
)
counted
toward
representation
.
thus
,
the
14th
amendment
changed
this
and
made
every
person
count
toward
representation
.
effectively
,
it
legitmized
the
position
of
former
slaves
as
full
citizens
,
whereas
before
they
were
clearly
not
.
 
and
what
i
'm
saying
is
these
rights
are
not
absolute
.
you
do
not
get
to
own
whatever
you
want
whenever
you
want
.
you
do
n't
get
to
automatically
own
incredibly
dangerous
weapons
.
or
else
why
could
n't
a
citizen
own
a
nuclear
warhead
,
or
why
are
there
regulations
on
gun
ownership
like
licensing
?
<new_line>
now
that
you
have
taken
a
proper
approach
towards
your
argument
,
i
do
agree
with
you
that
they
were
referring
to
as
blacks
and
other
minorities
including
the
native
indians
as
well
as
"
3/5
of
all
other
persons
"
because
the
presence
of
the
british
was
still
influencing
america
at
that
point
and
the
rise
of
civil
rights
movements
caused
the
blacks
to
be
free
from
slavery
through
rebellion
against
the
dictators
.
however
,
at
that
point
,
the
constitution
was
never
reviewed
and
was
recently
created
by
the
wealthy
upper
class
white
members
of
society
who
thought
that
their
actions
were
wise
.
further
review
of
the
constitution
lead
to
the
institution
of
the
14th
ammendment
and
due
process
clause
.
but
as
it
is
,
the
constitution
has
been
reviewed
for
years
and
found
to
be
appropiately
fair
not
only
by
legislators
but
by
several
courts
and
human
rights
committee
including
the
u.s
supreme
court
.
if
you
recalled
in
my
argument
,
i
did
not
mention
the
term
"
broad
rights
,
"
instead
i
mentioned
the
term
"
certain
rights
.
"
this
certain
right
was
referring
to
the
the
use
of
applicable
firearms
for
self
defence
and
automatic
firearms
were
ruled
to
be
liable
for
self
defence
.
so
,
certain
rights
would
extend
to
the
use
of
automatic
firearms
for
the
use
of
self
defence
by
civilians
.
and
you
said
it
yourself
,
the
people
's
actions
are
limited
by
the
government
through
the
process
of
licensing
,
thus
,
through
this
process
,
the
government
gets
to
monitor
the
use
of
firearms
by
the
civilian
population
.
<new_line>
and
thus
the
government
may
decide
what
is
sufficient
in
order
for
civilians
to
defend
themselves
.
i
believe
automatic
weapons
do
not
fall
within
that
domain
.
<new_line>
if
you
believe
automatic
weapons
do
not
fall
within
that
domain
then
point
to
a
specific
clause
stating
or
proving
your
point
.
what
you
believe
is
your
opinion
,
not
the
fact
.
<new_line>
my
argument
is
stated
in
previous
entries
.
<new_line>
your
argument
is
based
on
your
opinion
.
i
do
nt
need
to
hear
your
opinions
.
i
need
to
hear
your
proof
.
you
said
that
the
people
's
use
of
firearm
is
restricted
,
so
if
that
truly
is
the
case
,
then
point
to
specific
clause
,
stating
so
in
any
parts
of
the
constitution
or
the
bill
of
rights
,
since
that
is
the
ultimate
source
of
rights
.
<new_line>
and
as
we
discussed
,
it
is
not
really
the
constitution
that
is
the
"
source
of
rights
.
"
rights
may
not
be
decided
on
the
whim
of
a
document
or
a
people
,
otherwise
then
they
're
not
rights
,
they
're
privileges
.
therefore
,
i
only
need
prove
that
the
"
rights
"
given
to
us
by
the
constitution
have
ever
been
limited
by
actions
from
the
government
,
to
extend
that
as
well
to
the
2nd
amendment
.
take
free
speech
,
which
has
often
times
been
limited
by
the
government
(
e.g.
you
can
not
yell
"
fire
"
when
there
is
in
fact
no
fire
)
when
it
is
deemed
that
said
right
may
be
dangerous
for
other
civilians
.
similarly
,
the
2nd
amendment
may
be
,
and
should
be
,
limited
in
scope
by
restricting
the
general
population
from
owning
automatic
firearms
.
actually
one
is
more
likely
to
be
involved
in
a
homicide
if
one
owns
a
gun
,
among
a
myriad
of
other
statistics
(
see
link
)
.
additionally
,
countries
with
more
restrictive
gun
control
laws
tend
to
have
a
higher
homicide
rate
.
making
guns
more
available
,
as
well
as
increasing
the
firepower
and
killing
power
of
a
single
weapon
would
dramatically
increase
one
's
susceptibility
to
violent
crime
via
guns
.
<new_line>
the
constitution
is
mot
merely
privileges
,
it
is
a
source
of
rights
.
point
out
one
phrase
in
the
constitution
that
mentions
the
terms
"
privileges
.
"
however
you
will
find
many
of
the
terms
listed
as
being
"
rights
.
"
you
claim
that
rights
have
not
been
decided
merely
on
the
basis
of
a
document
but
bear
in
mind
rights
were
decided
by
the
u.s
supreme
court
on
the
every
document
that
we
should
refer
as
being
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
.
the
rights
guaranteed
in
the
constitution
can
not
be
limited
unless
one
trespasses
the
limits
of
these
constitutional
rights
which
are
no
longer
protected
by
the
government
.
yelling
fire
in
a
crowd
when
there
is
no
fire
is
not
free
speech
as
you
claim
because
according
to
the
law
,
it
produces
a
bad
result
definitely
,
since
it
can
cause
panic
and
can
even
cause
injury
because
people
might
try
to
escape
in
panic
.
in
some
instances
,
yelling
fire
in
a
crowd
when
there
is
no
fire
in
a
building
can
cause
people
to
block
up
the
exit
leading
to
a
depletion
of
oxyen
which
can
result
in
people
dying
.
therefore
,
this
is
not
a
right
as
you
claim
.
this
is
an
act
of
crime
that
can
result
in
severe
danger
or
death
to
others
.
if
i
recall
you
stated
in
your
argument
that
"
the
2nd
amendment
may
be
,
and
should
be
.
"
the
words
"
may
"
and
"
should
"
illustrates
that
not
even
you
yourself
is
certain
in
whether
your
perception
of
this
issue
is
actually
factual
or
just
opinionated
.
furthermore
,
weapons
in
the
whole
can
increase
a
person
's
susceptibility
to
commit
violent
crimes
but
if
that
is
true
then
:
a
)
that
includes
and
covers
the
possession
and
ownership
of
small
guns
as
well
so
they
should
also
be
banned
and
b
)
how
come
the
crime
rate
for
legal
owners
of
firearms
has
been
significantly
lower
than
that
of
the
crime
rate
for
illegal
firearm
owners
?
<new_line>
you
misunderstand
my
problem
with
so
-
called
"
rights
.
"
i
am
saying
rights
(
fundamental
,
universal
,
human
)
are
not
granted
via
a
document
or
supreme
court
ruling
.
these
rights
would
include
liberty
,
pursuit
of
happiness
,
and
equality
.
these
are
vague
constructs
,
yet
seem
to
be
morally
appropriate
to
guarantee
to
all
human
beings
,
and
thus
are
rights
of
all
human
beings
.
the
constitution
attempts
to
distinguish
specific
ways
to
achieve
these
various
universal
rights
,
and
thus
they
are
limited
in
their
focus
and
intent
.
that
is
why
i
would
rather
not
speak
of
the
bill
of
rights
or
the
constitution
as
a
way
of
measuring
a
right
but
rather
a
privilege
.
 
and
thus
you
contradict
yourself
in
one
sentence
.
how
can
they
not
be
limited
,
and
yet
still
have
limits
,
which
trespassing
those
limits
results
in
the
creation
of
limits
?
my
example
of
yelling
fire
in
a
crowd
was
a
perfect
example
of
even
how
freedom
of
speech
(
i.e.
to
say
what
you
will
when
you
will
)
is
limited
for
the
benefit
of
the
majority
.
thus
we
may
place
similar
restrictions
on
other
rights
to
benefit
the
majority
.
additionally
"
may
"
merely
reflected
the
observation
that
the
2nd
amendment
has
been
limited
before
,
and
"
should
"
reflected
my
opinion
that
it
should
be
.
i
'm
sorry
,
your
analysis
of
simple
language
mechanics
is
faulty
,
and
it
appears
you
seem
to
be
grasping
at
straws
.
 
no
,
they
should
be
restricted
.
like
any
policy
,
there
is
a
"
sweet
spot
"
of
regulation
and
freedom
.
too
much
regulation
and
people
no
longer
have
the
"
right
"
and
too
little
and
it
is
nearing
anarchy
.
currently
,
it
appears
to
me
that
gun
laws
are
much
too
lax
,
and
should
be
strengthened
.
 
do
you
see
how
i
provided
actual
,
factual
statistics
?
do
you
see
how
you
have
not
?
<new_line>
first
of
all
,
prove
to
me
that
righ5ts
are
not
granted
via
document
or
court
ruling
.
the
u.s
supreme
court
has
not
granted
any
civilians
rights
but
they
have
interpreted
the
rights
available
in
the
constitution
and
prohibit
the
government
from
violating
these
rights
.
if
the
supreme
court
and
any
document
which
you
are
claiming
was
not
the
source
of
rights
,
then
why
were
various
case
laws
made
from
these
sources
and
why
was
the
government
prohibited
from
passing
laws
that
would
violate
the
constitutional
rights
of
civilians
.
if
i
recall
,
the
supreme
court
has
dealt
with
various
cases
regarding
racial
bias
,
due
process
,
4
th
amendment
searches
and
seizures
as
well
as
racial
stereotyping
.
the
court
ruled
in
all
these
cases
that
due
process
and
equality
has
been
denied
in
these
cases
and
therefore
these
people
were
freed
because
the
source
of
their
rights
,
the
constitutional
rights
were
violated
.
a
privilege
is
something
that
you
can
take
away
whereas
rights
are
something
you
can
not
take
from
a
citizen
.
again
,
you
seem
to
be
having
a
hard
time
in
understanding
the
technicality
of
my
perception
.
how
can
you
call
the
commission
of
a
crime
as
a
right
?
if
one
does
something
that
produces
a
bad
result
and
can
endanger
other
lives
,
how
can
you
refer
to
that
as
being
a
right
or
privilege
?
what
you
are
referring
to
is
not
freedom
of
speech
.
that
is
referred
to
as
a
crime
.
there
is
a
difference
between
something
that
we
enjoy
as
a
right
but
does
not
protect
us
from
committing
crimes
.
for
example
,
the
freedom
of
speech
also
extends
to
actions
,
meaning
that
we
have
a
right
to
display
our
actions
,
so
lets
assume
that
i
have
a
right
to
free
speech
,
does
that
mean
i
can
go
and
burn
down
buildings
or
killing
people
to
get
my
message
across
because
i
have
a
right
to
free
speech
?
again
,
your
example
is
a
crime
and
not
a
right
.
you
should
read
up
on
what
adds
up
to
a
right
and
a
crime
respectively
.
if
i
was
in
a
debate
in
court
and
used
the
term
"
may
"
people
would
assume
i
myself
am
not
sure
of
the
point
i
am
trying
to
get
across
.
that
proves
that
you
are
not
certain
if
what
you
are
saying
is
the
truth
or
you
think
it
might
be
true
or
not
true
what
you
are
saying
.
my
analysis
of
simple
language
is
based
on
the
language
you
put
forth
so
do
n't
blame
me
for
observing
for
what
is
put
forth
in
front
of
me
.
let
me
give
you
an
example
,
if
cops
arrive
on
a
scene
to
arrest
a
person
and
the
person
is
suspected
of
being
in
a
building
so
the
cops
approach
you
and
ask
you
if
he
is
in
the
building
or
not
and
you
respond
by
saying
"
maybe
"
then
that
means
that
you
are
not
sure
but
you
think
he
might
be
.
you
see
the
difference
between
certainty
and
uncertainty
and
how
words
illustrate
our
inner
opinions
or
may
contradict
our
points
?
i
think
you
are
failing
to
realize
or
accept
that
restrictions
will
have
no
effect
on
guns
.
these
people
need
to
be
monitored
.
what
evidence
have
you
provided
?
factual
evidence
from
the
fbi
?
which
is
responsible
for
collecting
and
storing
records
of
crime
?
<new_line>
our
perceptions
of
rights
differ
in
my
definition
is
an
absolute
,
i.e.
rights
exist
regardless
of
documents
,
and
yours
are
relative
,
i.e.
a
document
provides
them
and
thus
are
limited
by
those
who
are
governed
by
those
documents
.
does
that
clear
up
the
matter
?
i
said
,
"
you
may
pass
me
the
cheese
now
,
"
quite
obviously
i
am
not
having
uncertainty
over
whether
or
not
i
will
receive
cheese
,
i
am
merely
being
polite
and
saying
you
are
physically
allowed
to
pass
me
the
cheese
.
i
believe
i
was
referring
to
restricting
the
second
amendment
in
this
way
,
i.e.
we
are
allowed
to
limit
/
regulate
that
right
.
 
and
thus
,
you
completely
ignored
my
simple
request
.
i
did
provide
several
studies
(
though
embedded
in
an
article
)
.
and
for
someone
who
has
such
little
faith
in
government
(
after
all
,
we
need
all
the
guns
we
can
get
to
protect
ourselves
from
their
tyranny
)
,
you
would
still
trust
their
studies
?
(
http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/homicide/weapons.cfm
)
(
http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/glance/tables/firearmnonfataltab.cfm
)
are
those
enough
trends
?
<new_line>
i
think
you
are
misunderstanding
the
perception
of
what
importance
that
document
serves
.
you
are
forgetting
that
since
we
do
not
get
our
rights
from
the
government
,
there
needs
to
be
a
document
which
is
the
ultimate
source
of
rights
that
serves
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
government
from
infringing
upon
our
rights
since
government
tends
to
act
in
conflict
to
the
interests
of
its
people
.
let
me
remind
you
that
when
this
constitution
was
created
back
then
,
it
first
had
to
be
approved
by
the
people
before
it
could
become
effective
and
to
this
day
,
it
still
is
accepted
and
approved
by
the
majority
of
the
population
.
you
are
failing
to
understand
that
there
is
a
difference
between
what
you
referred
to
as
being
a
crime
and
what
is
actually
a
right
.
how
can
we
have
a
right
to
commit
a
crime
when
the
example
you
gave
is
clearly
a
crime
?
governments
are
not
limiting
our
rights
because
the
right
you
are
referring
to
is
not
a
right
but
rather
a
crime
,
therefore
that
can
not
be
found
in
the
source
of
rights
because
it
is
a
violation
of
the
laws
.
if
you
said
to
me
that
you
may
pass
me
the
cheese
,
you
used
the
term
may
because
you
are
not
certain
if
i
will
.
if
you
used
the
term
please
,
then
you
are
displaying
a
sign
of
politeness
.
finally
,
i
did
take
a
look
at
those
statistics
you
sent
to
me
and
there
is
one
major
problem
that
i
observed
.
why
is
it
that
your
graph
fails
to
point
out
what
proportion
of
these
crimes
were
committed
by
legal
or
illegal
firearm
holders
?
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
,
all
these
crimes
could
have
been
committed
by
illegal
firearm
holders
because
the
graph
itself
fails
to
refer
if
these
gun
crimes
were
committed
by
illegal
and
or
legal
firearm
holders
,
thus
the
proof
you
sent
me
still
do
not
justify
the
point
you
are
trying
to
make
.
i
am
surprised
that
you
questioned
my
faith
in
a
government
by
trusting
their
statistics
when
your
argument
illustrates
a
low
level
of
faith
in
the
government
,
but
yet
at
the
same
time
,
you
are
using
government
statistics
.
and
like
i
mentioned
,
your
studies
make
no
distinctions
of
gun
crimes
committed
by
illegal
and
legal
firearm
holders
so
how
are
we
supposed
to
figure
out
which
category
makes
up
the
larger
portion
of
those
crimes
committed
?
<new_line>
the
key
word
is
law
abiding
citizen
.
law
abiding
citizens
are
not
criminals
,
therefore
,
they
have
no
reason
to
use
these
weapons
unless
for
self
defense
of
oneself
or
others
.
<new_line>
i
'm
saying
that
the
whims
of
the
majority
do
not
guarantee
,
grant
,
or
deny
anyone
rights
.
thus
,
neither
does
the
document
.
rights
are
an
intrinsic
aspect
of
an
existence
.
you
may
not
say
,
"
oh
,
i
do
n't
like
him
,
so
i
'm
going
to
write
a
document
and
get
it
approved
by
the
governing
force
to
take
away
his
rights
.
"
do
you
recognize
how
ridiculous
that
is
?
 
please
,
give
this
up
.
this
is
a
very
small
straw
you
're
grasping
at
.
focus
on
substantive
parts
of
my
argument
.
how
about
a
quote
:
"
in
the
1992
-
93
kansas
city
experiment
,
a
number
of
police
officers
in
the
inner
city
of
kansas
city
were
put
specifically
and
entirely
on
the
duty
of
searching
for
and
eliminating
illegal
firearms
.
this
heightened
crackdown
took
place
over
a
period
of
29
weeks
,
after
which
results
were
studied
and
compared
with
those
of
the
first
,
unchanged
29
weeks
.
after
the
29
weeks
of
heightened
activity
against
illegal
firearms
,
the
rates
of
gun
crimes
in
the
part
of
the
city
monitored
decreased
significantly
,
by
almost
50
%
,
whereas
the
"
control
"
section
of
the
city
,
in
which
a
crackdown
on
illegal
guns
was
not
enforced
,
experienced
no
change
in
its
crime
rate
.
"
quite
obviously
,
if
police
crack
down
on
illegal
firearms
,
and
gun
crime
rate
decreases
by
almost
50
%
,
you
see
that
most
gun
crime
is
committed
by
illegal
firearms
.
that
is
why
it
stands
to
reason
that
by
making
more
powerful
guns
more
readily
available
,
crime
rate
would
probably
be
increased
because
criminals
would
have
much
greater
access
to
much
more
powerful
weapons
.
please
,
read
the
site
i
provided
earlier
:
http://www.guninformation.org/
also
,
it
appears
that
yet
again
,
i
am
the
only
one
providing
a
factual
,
statistical
backup
for
my
responses
.
<new_line>
it
amazes
me
that
you
seem
to
be
having
a
hard
time
to
grasp
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
.
if
the
rights
come
from
the
people
,
then
it
takes
majority
of
the
people
to
put
that
right
into
effect
.
rights
do
not
just
come
from
anywhere
,
they
come
from
the
people
.
one
senior
prosecutor
examined
your
argument
last
night
and
told
me
to
ask
you
,
if
you
do
not
need
a
document
to
prove
that
you
have
rights
,
then
how
come
you
need
a
document
to
prove
in
a
court
of
law
that
you
are
innocent
when
you
are
already
innocent
and
also
said
that
you
should
point
to
any
specific
part
of
the
constitution
that
states
the
term
"
privileges
.
"
why
would
the
people
write
a
document
to
take
away
somebody
else
rights
when
the
same
rights
that
they
have
created
for
themselves
would
apply
to
all
citizens
of
that
country
.
do
you
know
how
ridiculous
that
argument
sounds
?
if
there
was
a
crack
down
on
illegal
firearms
,
then
that
points
out
to
the
fact
that
if
government
monitors
the
using
of
firearms
by
civilians
then
the
level
of
firearm
crimes
will
decrease
.
this
is
a
form
of
monitoring
in
which
certain
requirements
are
not
met
,
so
the
government
seizes
hold
of
that
firearm
until
the
requirements
are
met
.
if
most
gun
crimes
are
committed
by
illegal
firearm
holders
then
it
means
that
legal
ownership
of
firearms
combined
with
government
monitoring
can
have
a
positive
effect
.
the
site
that
you
provided
me
with
seems
to
be
lacking
impartiality
since
it
seems
to
be
biased
.
at
the
beginning
of
the
site
,
the
author
did
not
post
his
name
(
i
wonder
why
nor
the
date
the
information
was
last
updated
or
published
)
and
because
of
his
bias
and
lack
of
impartiality
,
any
information
obtained
would
be
biased
since
he
is
obtaining
information
to
satisfy
his
level
of
bias
.
in
all
of
his
argument
or
evidence
,
he
introduced
sources
who
were
biased
to
gun
rights
which
leads
me
to
wonder
why
did
he
not
introduce
sources
favorable
to
gun
rights
and
then
produce
counter
sources
to
counter
act
the
point
made
by
those
sources
?
secondly
,
some
of
the
sources
were
from
religious
sources
which
is
an
issue
since
sources
that
are
religious
in
nature
would
tend
to
mix
religion
with
logic
.
thirdly
,
some
of
the
results
in
the
research
were
conducted
in
different
countries
,
which
is
unacceptable
for
me
to
read
since
you
can
not
in
any
way
compare
a
country
to
the
united
states
because
there
can
be
more
than
one
factor
that
can
be
causing
the
gun
crime
rate
there
and
also
there
is
a
difference
in
the
size
of
the
country
and
the
population
as
well
as
social
issues
.
"
gary
kleck
and
marc
gertz
have
found
that
as
many
as
400,000
people
per
year
use
guns
in
situations
in
which
they
later
claimed
that
the
gun
almost
saved
their
lives
.
even
if
these
estimates
are
off
by
a
factor
of
10
,
it
means
that
armed
citizens
may
save
40
,
000
lives
yearly

also
the
source
of
the
problem
is
illegal
firearm
ownership
because
according
to
the
national
crime
victimization
center
,
illegal
firearms
are
used
in
about
20
percent
of
robberies
,
10
percent
of
assaults
and
5
percent
of
rapes
.
therefore
,
if
you
outlaw
automatic
guns
criminals
will
still
have
access
to
these
guns
because
there
are
still
gangs
who
have
access
to
these
guns
and
can
sell
them
to
earn
a
profit
.
"
banning
the
use
of
firearms
will
lead
to
that
gun
having
more
value
which
can
lead
to
an
increased
trafficking
in
gun
as
well
as
other
illegal
substances

<new_line>
so
what
you
're
saying
is
rights
are
decided
by
a
majority
?
you
have
the
freedom
of
speech
because
a
bunch
of
people
voted
that
people
should
be
allowed
to
speak
there
mind
?
does
that
not
also
imply
that
rights
may
be
taken
away
in
a
similar
manner
?
therefore
,
that
"
right
"
is
not
so
much
a
right
in
that
it
is
yours
no
matter
what
as
much
as
it
is
a
privilege
granted
to
you
by
a
population
.
i
am
saying
rights
are
absolutes
,
transient
of
any
human
document
.
you
're
saying
rights
are
fabrications
of
a
human
society
and
thus
vary
not
just
from
place
to
place
but
person
to
person
as
well
.
i
do
not
understand
how
a
document
is
proof
.
a
document
proves
something
has
happened
before
.
it
does
not
physically
allow
or
disallow
you
to
do
things
.
a
document
really
has
no
power
beyond
the
power
people
place
in
it
.
 
it
does
n't
.
i
'm
just
disputing
your
concept
of
what
is
a
right
.
 
that
was
the
entire
point
.
 
your
entire
argument
was
based
on
the
efficiency
of
government
monitoring
and
thus
being
able
to
crackdown
on
illegal
firearms
(
i
think
.
your
argument
was
confusingly
worded
,
e.g.
"
certain
requirements
"
)
.
why
did
you
suddenly
lump
"
legal
ownership
of
firearms
"
into
the
argument
when
you
had
previously
not
substantiated
that
claim
?

"
this
argument
is
actually
addressed
by
a
harvard
professor
of
health
policy
,
david
hemenway
.
he
states
:
"
since
a
small
percentage
of
people
may
report
virtually
anything
on
a
telephone
survey
,
there
are
serious
risks
of
overestimation
in
using
such
surveys
to
measure
rare
events
.
the
problem
becomes
particularly
severe
when
the
issue
has
even
a
remote
possibility
of
positive
social
desirability
response
bias
.
consider
the
responses
to
a
national
random
-
digit
-
dial
telephone
survey
of
over
1500
adults
conducted
in
may
1994
by
abc
news
and
the
washington
post
.
[

]
one
question
asked
:
'
have
you
yourself
ever
seen
anything
that
you
believe
was
a
spacecraft
from
another
planet
?
'
[
page
1438
]
ten
percent
of
respondents
answered
in
the
affirmative
.
these
150
individuals
were
then
asked
,
'
have
you
personally
ever
been
in
contact
with
aliens
from
another
planet
or
not
?
'
and
6
%
answered
'
yes
.
'by
extrapolating
to
the
national
population
,
we
might
conclude
that
almost
20
million
americans
have
seen
spacecraft
from
another
planet
,
and
over
a
million
have
been
in
personal
contact
with
aliens
from
other
planets
.
that
more
than
a
million
americans
had
contact
with
aliens
would
be
incredible
news
--
but
not
the
kind
actively
publicized
by
reputable
scientists
.
"
 
yes
of
course
,
and
you
are
n't
either
?
 
and
what
exactly
is
your
basis
to
say
that
religious
people
would
falsify
data
or
conduct
irresponsible
surveys
?
you
imply
that
religious
people
are
illogical
(
or
that
the
two
are
mutually
exclusive
)
but
i
have
met
very
many
religious
people
who
are
exceptionally
logical
.
actually
,
it
would
be
illogical
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
absolutely
no
way
religion
is
right
about
(
a
)
god(s
)
,
as
it
is
simply
impossible
for
either
side
to
prove
existence
or
nonexistence
.
therefore
,
to
assume
that
religious
people
are
illogical
would
be
itself
a
logical
fallacy
.
 
yes
of
course
,
you
may
not
compare
other
countries
to
the
us
when
talking
about
guns
,
except
of
course
when
it
's
the
countries
with
low
crime
rates
and
low
gun
control
.
 
and
making
guns
more
available
will
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
right
?
making
automatic
weapons
cheap
and
readily
available
will
completely
disincentivize
ownership
of
automatic
weapons
.
<new_line>
rights
have
always
been
decided
by
the
majority
because
it
takes
the
cooperation
of
the
majority
to
put
it
into
effect
.
but
anyway
since
we
both
agree
that
rights
exist
but
we
disagree
on
the
sources
of
rights
i
will
address
that
.
th
constitution
is
a
document
that
was
written
and
preserved
and
handed
down
from
one
generation
to
the
next
.
it
is
a
living
proof
that
we
are
protected
by
rights
which
guarantees
protection
from
the
government
.
before
that
constitution
,
was
created
,
majority
of
the
people
voted
for
it
to
be
put
into
effect
.
if
you
do
n't
believe
that
rights
come
from
the
majority
then
how
come
laws
are
created
with
the
approval
of
majority
of
the
population
?
how
come
before
we
can
over
throw
a
government
,
majority
of
the
votes
from
the
population
needs
to
outweigh
the
minor
?
how
come
when
a
supreme
or
appellate
courts
decides
a
case
,
it
takes
majority
of
the
votes
to
make
a
decision
in
that
case
?
the
human
society
was
and
is
constructed
in
such
a
way
that
the
larger
population
decides
what
is
a
right
and
hardly
have
they
taken
away
a
right
from
somebody
else
.
did
n't
majority
of
the
population
voted
for
certain
actions
to
be
labelled
criminal
,
so
would
you
say
that
is
unfair
because
majority
of
the
population
took
away
the
right
from
another
civilian
to
commit
a
crime
?
that
is
the
very
reason
why
a
document
has
power
,
because
it
is
made
up
of
the
power
the
people
gave
it
that
power
which
serves
as
a
proof
against
governmental
infringement
of
our
rights
.
furthermore
,
at
that
time
the
constitution
was
created
,
there
was
no
opposition
to
it
from
the
people
.
i
am
surprise
you
were
arguing
earlier
that
the
constitution
is
privileged
but
yet
in
the
same
document
you
are
disputing
you
can
not
point
to
one
specific
word
pointing
to
privilege
meanwhile
at
the
same
time
you
will
find
many
amendment
such
as
the
4th
amendment
beginning
with
"
the
right
of
the
people
.
"
it
is
interesting
that
you
do
not
see
"
certain
rights
"
as
related
to
the
2
amendment
as
i
am
explaining
and
repeating
myself
for
the
3rd
time
which
goes
back
that
firearms
can
not
be
restricted
to
people
especially
since
it
is
designed
in
a
way
that
is
useful
for
self
defense
(
automatic
firearm
)
.
if
you
do
n't
understand
government
monitoring
to
be
legal
ownership
then
i
advise
you
to
put
your
critical
thinking
skills
to
work
before
responding
to
an
argument
.
your
argument
and
the
evidence
you
introduced
is
weak
.
the
source
i
introduced
is
a
source
that
is
valid
and
is
being
used
by
all
schools
offering
law
and
pre
-
law
countrywide
.
moreover
,
the
author
of
that
textbook
is
the
chairperson
of
john
jay
school
of
criminal
justice
as
well
as
a
professor
at
many
other
law
schools
.
he
is
also
a
criminologist
and
one
of
the

secondly
,
how
do
you
know
that
these
surveys
were
completed
via
telephone
?
how
do
you
know
that
these
researchers
were
not
representing
a
government
funded
research
?
i
see
no
point
in
a
rebuttal
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
source
i
have
introduced
.
he
said
that
he
would
like
to
introduce
information
pertaining
to
gun
control
and
introduced
sources
which
were
from
religious
sources
and
other
sources
that
all
demonstrated
campaigns
against
firearm
rights
in
general
.
why
did
you
not
answer
the
part
where
i
asked
you
why
he
did
not
introduced
statistics
from
the
supporter
researches
of
gun
rights
and
why
does
he
fail
to
mention
his
name
?
we
are
in
a
debate
but
he
is
introducing
factual
information
,
thus
there
is
a
difference
between
my
method
of
debating
and
his
method
of
presenting
information
.
sources
that
are
religious
tend
to
produce
bias
information
because
their
emotions
prevents
them
from
accepting
logical
information
in
terms
of
issues
pertaining
to
social
structure
.
i
did
not
in
any
way
mentioned
they
are
illogical
or
logical
.
my
point
i
am
trying
to
establish
is
that
they
have
a
religious
view
on
certain
logical
issues
that
causes
them
to
produce
information
to
satisfy
their
logic
.
take
abortion
and
prostitution
as
examples
.
also
if
you
recall
my
point
i
said
mix
religion
with
logic
.
what
part
of
that
statement
points
to
what
you
are
illustrating
?
low
crime
rates
can
be
the
result
of
better
social
structure
and
not
just
low
gun
rate
.
it
could
be
the
result
of
a
smaller
population
and
better
availability
of
education
and
jobs
.
these
are
all
issues
pertaining
to
crime
so
hence
,
your
argument
is
merely
opinionated
rather
than
factual
.
the
point
that
you
are
failing
to
understand
that
illegal
firearms
will
contribute
to
more
people
owning
guns
illegally
without
the
government
having
any
knowledge
thereof
and
can
cause
a
increase
in
crime
.
therefore
the
best
form
of
system
is
a
system
of
monitoring
firearms
users
,
not
restrict
them
.
<new_line>
all
citizens
have
been
law
abiding
till
the
point
where
they
break
the
rules
-
and
even
then
,
if
they
are
n't
caught
they
are
still
regarded
as
law
abiding
.
"
law
abiding
citizens
"
means
nothing
as
all
wicked
people
have
been
a
"
decent
citizen
"
(
as
noted
by
law
)
at
some
point
prior
to
their
crime(s
)
.
on
the
other
hand
,
i
do
wish
i
could
have
a
gun
under
my
dress
tucked
into
my
stocking
that
i
can
whip
out
whenever
a
drunken
ass
approaches
me
.
we
ca
n't
have
it
both
ways
though
can
we
?
we
do
n't
know
a
bad
man
till
he
has
given
us
a
reason
to
think
/
know
he
is
bad
.
for
all
you
know
,
your
neighbour
could
be
a
murderer
/
rapist
,
but
he
just
has
n't
been
caught
yet
which
means
that
at
this
moment
he
is
considered
by
law
to
be
a
law
abiding
citizen
,
who
,
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
who
picked
no
in
this
argument
,
is
permitted
to
own
a
firearm
.
fair
?
nope
.
<new_line>
i
can
essentially
ignore
the
rest
of
your
argument
and
point
out
one
specific
point
:
 
firstly
,
of
course
my
argument
is
opinionated
.
that
is
what
an
argument
is
.
it
is
based
on
facts
(
and
you
calling
them
"
weak
"
simply
because
the
other
did
not
provide
you
facts
that
you
would
like
to
have
used
does
not
negate
that
he
does
in
fact
present
facts
)
.
secondly
,
yes
,
your
argument
about
those
issues
all
pertaining
to
crime
is
entirely
valid
.
so
why
then
can
you
say
that
if
we
were
to
have
automatic
weapons
,
we
would
be
safer
?
countries
with
legal
automatic
weapons
would
have
different
demographics
.
various
states
have
various
demographics
where
perhaps
an
automatic
weapon
would
be
beneficial
,
as
do
counties
,
cities
and
neighborhoods
.
you
must
recognize
that
we
must
be
able
to
compare
a
very
broad
swath
of
humanity
(
the
us
is
a
big
place
)
and
say
that
for
the
majority
of
places
in
the
us
,
automatic
weapons
would
not
provide
enough
of
a
benefit
to
outweigh
their
risks
.
eh
,
i
ca
n't
resist
the
rest
of
your
argument
.
well
,
most
of
it
.
i
feel
we
should
limit
our
discussion
to
the
discussion
of
automatic
weapons
and
thus
eliminate
our
discussion
of
where
rights
originate
as
it
has
grown
quite
off
topic
.
i
'll
make
a
separate
debate
for
it
if
you
wish
.
 
i
do
n't
not
understand
your
argument
,
it
is
just
the
phrasing
and
syntax
is
quite
amorphous
.
 
and
my
refutation
of
that
source
was
a
man
named
david
hemenway
,
a
professor
of
health
policy
at
the
harvard
school
of
public
health
,
director
of
the
harvard
injury
control
research
center
,
among
other
titles
related
to
the
field
of
public
health
.
i
would
posit
he
is
a
reliable
source
.
 
this
is
how
i
know
,
"
we
use
the
most
anonymous
possible
national
survey
format
,
the
anonymous
random
digit
dialed
telephone
survey
.
"
(
http://www.guncite.com/gcdgklec.html
)
 
because
kleck
makes
it
quite
clear
that
he
does
not
accept
the
data
compiled
by
the
bureau
of
the
census
to
be
valid
.
 
and
thus
they
are
illogical
.
i
'm
sorry
,
but
that
is
what
you
are
saying
,
and
i
find
it
incredibly
narrow
-
minded
to
dismiss
a
survey
(
not
an
interpretation
of
a
survey
,
but
the
survey
itself
)
based
on
the
fact
that
it
was
conducted
by
a
religious
organization
.
 
that
would
be
okay
,
but
to
introduce
information
that
supports
gun
control
?
off
with
his
head
!
the
point
is
,
yes
,
if
you
bothered
to
read
any
of
the
rest
of
the
site
,
you
would
notice
that
quite
obviously
the
author
is
a
gun
control
advocate
.
however
,
that
does
not
dismiss
the
information
he
presented
.
information
is
information
.
 
your
first
sentence
is
perhaps
the
most
circular
argument
i
've
heard
:
illegal
firearms
will
cause
more
people
to
own
guns
illegal
because
they
will
be
illegal
if
people
own
them
.
obviously
.
however
,
you
fail
to
understand
that
if
you
make
automatic
weapons
legal
(
and
all
weapons
apparently
.
you
say
earlier
in
your
argument
suddenly
that
you
are
advocating
a
complete
lack
of
restrictions
on
firearms
,
"
firearms
can
not
be
restricted
to
people
,
"
although
i
believe
we
had
previously
discussed
how
it
was
necessary
to
restrict
gun
activities
from
various
groups
of
people
-
like
insane
people
or
criminals
-
or
to
make
it
necessary
for
government
regulation
of
the
gun
market
.
this
seems
like
a
frightening
prospect
,
much
more
so
than
a
restriction
of
automatic
weapons
.
)
,
the
pool
of
automatic
weapons
will
in
fact
enlarge
,
and
more
people
will
own
them
,
and
the
weapons
will
be
more
accessible
by
those
who
may
have
been
hesitant
about
ownership
simply
because
of
their
illegal
nature
.
suddenly
,
it
would
seem
more
acceptable
to
rob
a
convenience
store
with
an
automatic
weapon
versus
a
handgun
or
a
knife
.
saying
that
having
a
small
pool
of
automatic
weapons
leads
to
a
greater
number
of
people
having
automatic
weapons
is
quite
illogical
.
<new_line>
unfortunately
,
automatic
weapons
were
not
designed
for
self
defense
,
and
i
am
not
entirely
sure
where
you
pulled
this
misinformation
from
.
i
have
here
the
patent
for
automatic
arms
.
http://www.google.com/patents?id=migtaaaaebaj&printsec;=abstract&zoom;=4&source;=gbs_overview_r&cad;=0#v=onepage&q;=a&f;=false
 
it
was
designed
by
a
military
brigadier
,
so
as
to
reduce
reload
times
,
and
kill
more
enemy
soldiers
.
and
here
is
the
source
stating
that
owning
a
gun
increases
the
likelihood
of
getting
shot
.
http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17922-carrying-a-gun-increases-risk-of-getting-shot-and-killed.html
 
i
do
agree
that
illegal
firearm
use
is
a
more
pressing
issue
than
legal
firearm
use-
yet
this
discussion
is
over
automatic
firearms
,
which
is
entirely
unnecessary
for
self
defense
.
should
a
gun
be
needed
,
a
rifle
,
pistol
,
or
shotgun
are
more
than
necessary
.
why
take
the
unnecessary
risk
of
using
an
uzi
to
shoot
in
self
defense
?
<new_line>
are
you
saying
that
by
being
a
law
-
abiding
citizen
,
it
becomes
impossible
to
have
accidents
involving
guns
?
because
as
far
as
i
know
following
the
law
does
not
make
one
an
a
sharp
shooter
capable
of
hitting
ones
attacker
and
nothing
else
.
<new_line>
because
any
law
abiding
citizen
can
have
his
mind
snap
and
reach
for
that
gun
to
kill
another
human
being

<new_line>

it

<new_line>
that

there
is
preciely
and
exactly
the
reason
us
fatal
firearm
related

are

about

<new_line>
i
live
in
the
united
kingdom
where
fire
arms
are
for
the
most
part
illegal
(
you
can
get
a
licence
for
hunting
guns
)
.
although
northern
ireland
have
slightly
different
laws
so
i
'll
dedicate
this
argument
to
england
/
wales
.
a
few
facts
about
the
lack
of
gun
crime
due
to
these
laws
.
a
home
office
study
published
in
2007
reported
that
gun
crime
in
england
&
wales
remains
a
relatively
rare
event
.
firearms
(
including
air
guns
)
were
used
in
21,521
recorded
crimes
.
it
said
that
injury
caused
during
a
firearm
offence
was
rare
with
fewer
than
3
%
resulting
in
a
serious
or
fatal
injury
.
in
2005/6
the
police
in
england
and
wales
reported
50
gun
homicides
,
a
rate
of
0.1
illegal
gun
deaths
per
100,000
of
population
.
only
6.6
%
of
homicides
involved
the
use
of
a
firearm
and
just
co
compare
our
rates
to
america
where
you
can
own
a
gun
.
by
way
of
international
comparison
,
in
2004
the
police
in
the
united
states
reported
9,326
gun
homicides
.
the
overall
homicide
rates
per
100,000
reported
by
the
united
nations
for
1999
were
4.55
for
the
u.s
.
and
1.45
in
england
and
wales
.
i
suppose
it
's
a
situation
where
you
have
to
be
persistent
and
absolute
with
the
law
.
if
a
lot
of
people
own
guns
in
a
country
others
feel
like
they
have
to
own
a
gun
for
their
own
protection
against
people
with
guns
.
so
it
ends
up
in
a
vicious
cycle
.
where
as
in
a
country
where
guns
are
illegal
to
own
on
almost
all
grounds
,
no
one
has
a
gun
so
the
reason
to
own
one
through
gun
threat
is
not
there
.
<new_line>
that
's
quite
a
wild
claim
to
make
.
these
people
were
'
exterminated
'
by
armies
,
i
do
n't
think
if
a
jewish
citizen
owned
a
gun
in
the
holocaust
they
could
defend
themselves
.
<new_line>
i
despise
people
who
glorify
the
killing
of
things
and
the
shooting
of
guns
that
are
meant
to
kill
people
.
but
,
i
still
believe
that
,
not
only
should
we
be
free
to
bear
arms
,
but
gun
ownership
should
be
mandatory
.
why
?
criminals
are
not
predators
.
criminals
are
parasites
.
cowards
.
when
a
criminal
thinks
there
's
significant
a
risk
that
he
'll
die
on
his
'
job
'
,
then
he
's
not
going
to
do
his
'
job
'
out
of
fear
.
this
is
proven
.
switzerland
(
or
sweden
or
something
)
has
mandatory
gun
ownership
for
all
citizens
,
and
they
have
some
of
the
lowest
crime
rates
in
the
entire
world

but
then
i
could
argue
that
there
are
countries
with
a
lower
crime
rate
and
murder
rate
than
switzerland
who
do
not
allow
guns
.
<new_line>
that
does
n't
invalidate
my
point
though
,
lol
.
it
just
shows
that
we
're
both
right
.
